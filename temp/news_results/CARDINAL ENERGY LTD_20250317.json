                "text": "Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - March 13, 2025) - Cardinal Energy Ltd. (TSX: CJ) (\"Cardinal\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce its operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR OF 2024\n\nAverage production for the fourth quarter was 21,916 boe/d which led to annual production of 21,776 boe/d, consistent with 2023 despite capital expenditures that were 12% lower year over year;\n\nAdjusted funds flow (1) for the fourth quarter was $65.1 million and for fiscal 2024 was $265.4 million, increases of 2% and 5% over the fourth quarter of 2023 and full year of 2023, respectively. For the full year 2024, adjusted funds flow was directed towards: Direct returns to shareholders through $115.5 million in declared dividends; Capital expenditures (1) on Cardinal's conventional assets of $103.3 million and thermal expenditures of $83.3 million; and Asset retirement and decommissioning liability expenditures of $10.2 million;\n\nConventional capital expenditures of $103.3 million were directed towards the drilling of 21 (20.1 net) wells across our asset base and continued infrastructure development;\n\nIn 2024, Cardinal invested approximately $74.3 million directly related to the Reford steam-assisted gravity drainage (\"SAGD\") project and also incurred $9.0 million of SAGD expenditures de-risking and expanding future projects through land and seismic expenditures and other indirect costs;\n\nNet operating costs per boe (1) for the fourth quarter were 2% lower than the comparative quarter mainly due to reduced power costs; and\n\nAt the end of 2024, Cardinal was drawn 31% or $85.6 million on our $275 million credit facility. In the first quarter of 2025, the Company closed two senior unsecured debenture financings totalling $105 million providing funding certainty for the Reford thermal project development and to de-risk future thermal projects.\n\nThe following table summarizes our fourth quarter and annual 2024 operating and financial highlights:\n\n($000's except shares, per share and operating amounts) Three months ended\n\nDecember 31\n\n\n\nYear ended\n\nDecember 31\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\n% Chg\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\n% Chg\n\nFinancial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetroleum and natural gas revenue\n\n147,778\n\n\n\n148,042\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n605,348\n\n\n\n589,605\n\n\n\n3\n\nCash flow from operating activities\n\n53,075\n\n\n\n69,305\n\n\n\n(23)\n\n\n\n247,537\n\n\n\n230,261\n\n\n\n8\n\nAdjusted funds flow(1)\n\n65,084\n\n\n\n63,968\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n265,441\n\n\n\n253,698\n\n\n\n5\n\nper share - basic $ 0.41\n\n$ 0.40\n\n\n\n2\n\n$ 1.67\n\n$ 1.61\n\n\n\n4\n\nper share - diluted $ 0.40\n\n$ 0.40\n\n\n\n-\n\n$ 1.65\n\n$ 1.59\n\n\n\n4\n\nEarnings\n\n25,817\n\n\n\n20,388\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n108,354\n\n\n\n103,598\n\n\n\n5\n\nper share - basic $ 0.16\n\n$ 0.13\n\n\n\n23\n\n$ 0.68\n\n$ 0.66\n\n\n\n3\n\nper share - diluted $ 0.16\n\n$ 0.13\n\n\n\n23\n\n$ 0.68\n\n$ 0.65\n\n\n\n5\n\nDevelopment capital expenditures(1)\n\n16,246\n\n\n\n15,521\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n100,536\n\n\n\n96,967\n\n\n\n4\n\nOther capital expenditures(1)\n\n324\n\n\n\n491\n\n\n\n(34)\n\n\n\n2,385\n\n\n\n2,571\n\n\n\n(7)\n\nProperty acquisitions, net(1)\n\n360\n\n\n\n25,290\n\n\n\n(99)\n\n\n\n360\n\n\n\n17,720\n\n\n\n(98)\n\nCapital expenditures(1)\n\n16,930\n\n\n\n41,302\n\n\n\n(59)\n\n\n\n103,281\n\n\n\n117,258\n\n\n\n(12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration & evaluation expenditures (\"E&E\")\n\n34,864\n\n\n\n4,320\n\n\n\nn/m\n\n\n\n83,279\n\n\n\n4,895\n\n\n\nn/m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon shares, net of treasury shares (000s)\n\n159,203\n\n\n\n158,095\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n159,203\n\n\n\n158,095\n\n\n\n1\n\nDividends declared\n\n28,656\n\n\n\n28,975\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n115,460\n\n\n\n115,807\n\n\n\n-\n\nPer share $ 0.18\n\n$ 0.18\n\n\n\n-\n\n$ 0.72\n\n$ 0.72\n\n\n\n-\n\nTotal payout ratio(1)\n\n69%\n\n\n\n70%\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n81%\n\n\n\n84%\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank debt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n85,610\n\n\n\n44,920\n\n\n\n91\n\nAdjusted working capital deficiency(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52,697\n\n\n\n38,730\n\n\n\n36\n\nNet debt(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n138,307\n\n\n\n83,650\n\n\n\n65\n\nNet debt to adjusted fund flow ratio(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n\n67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage daily production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight oil (bbl/d)\n\n7,271\n\n\n\n8,566\n\n\n\n(15)\n\n\n\n7,222\n\n\n\n8,084\n\n\n\n(11)\n\nMedium/heavy oil (bbl/d)\n\n11,556\n\n\n\n10,100\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n11,438\n\n\n\n10,164\n\n\n\n13\n\nNGL (bbl/d)\n\n827\n\n\n\n891\n\n\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n817\n\n\n\n817\n\n\n\n-\n\nConventional natural gas (mcf/d)\n\n13,569\n\n\n\n15,644\n\n\n\n(13)\n\n\n\n13,795\n\n\n\n15,838\n\n\n\n(13)\n\nTotal (boe/d)\n\n21,916\n\n\n\n22,164\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n21,776\n\n\n\n21,705\n\n\n\n-\n\nNetback ($/boe)(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetroleum and natural gas revenue\n\n73.29\n\n\n\n72.60\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n75.95\n\n\n\n74.43\n\n\n\n2\n\nRoyalties\n\n(14.07 )\n\n(14.62 )\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n(14.27 )\n\n(14.22 )\n\n-\n\nNet operating expenses(1)\n\n(22.76 )\n\n(23.19 )\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n(24.23 )\n\n(24.31 )\n\n-\n\nTransportation expenses\n\n(1.21 )\n\n(1.10 )\n\n10\n\n\n\n(1.10 )\n\n(1.00 )\n\n10\n\nNetback(1)\n\n35.25\n\n\n\n33.69\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n36.35\n\n\n\n34.90\n\n\n\n4\n\nRealized gain on commodity contracts\n\n0.01\n\n\n\n0.59\n\n\n\n(98)\n\n\n\n0.14\n\n\n\n0.32\n\n\n\n(56)\n\nInterest and other\n\n(0.68 )\n\n(0.89 )\n\n(24)\n\n\n\n(0.64 )\n\n(0.83 )\n\n(23)\n\nG&A\n\n(2.30 )\n\n(2.02 )\n\n14\n\n\n\n(2.55 )\n\n(2.37 )\n\n8\n\nAdjusted funds flow(1)\n\n32.28\n\n\n\n31.37\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n33.30\n\n\n\n32.02\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n(1) See non-GAAP and other financial measures.\n\nn/m Not meaningful or not calculable\n\nFourth Quarter Overview\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, oil prices were lower than the third quarter of 2024 and lower than the prior year comparative quarter. West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") benchmark oil price averaged US$70.27/bbl during the fourth quarter compared to US$75.10/bbl in the third quarter of 2024 and US$78.32/bbl in the prior year comparative quarter. Partially offsetting the decreased global oil prices, Canadian Western Canadian Select (\"WCS\") oil differentials narrowed by 7% over the third quarter of 2024 and by 43% over the comparative quarter in 2023. In addition, the Canadian dollar has weakened by approximately 3% which positively impacts the price Cardinal receives for its oil.\n\nDespite the weaker global oil prices, Cardinal's oil revenue was consistent with the prior quarter due to a 3% increase in oil production combined with the narrower Canadian oil differentials and the weaker Canadian dollar. Increased production was due to new production additions from our successful third quarter drilling program partially offset by the Midale facility turnaround which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2024. Fourth quarter 2024 adjusted funds flow of $65.1 million was 2% higher than the same period in 2023 and consistent with the third quarter of 2024.\n\nCapital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $16.9 million, including two (2.0 net) wells drilled and completed at Tide Lake, Alberta, $1.6 million on recompletions and workovers throughout our operating areas combined with continued facility and infrastructure upgrades. Cardinal continued our enhanced oil recovery operations, utilizing a combination of CO 2 injection and water flood.\n\nThe Company's financial position continues to be strong. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company increased its borrowing base credit facility to $275 million and added a new lender to the banking syndicate. In 2025, as previously announced, the Company closed two fixed term unsecured debenture financings totalling $105 million. With this incremental liquidity, we have de-risked the funding required for the completion of the Reford SAGD project and future SAGD projects while maintaining our long-term conventional production levels. Although we have access to sufficient capital resources, we will continue to be responsible in our capital allocation and endeavor to maintain a net debt to adjusted funds flow ratio(1) below 1.0x.\n\nFrom a risk management perspective, in the first quarter of 2025, Cardinal fixed the WCS differential to WTI on 5,000 bbl/d at a price of -US$12.75/bbl for the period of April 2025 to September 2025 reducing the risk of differentials widening through the North American tariff uncertainty. The Company also has an AECO collar for 2025 on 2,500 GJ/d of natural gas with a floor of $1.75/GJ and a ceiling of $2.70/GJ.\n\n(1) See non-GAAP and other financial measures.\n\nConventional Operations\n\nCardinal's average production was 21,776 boe/d in 2024. In Cardinal's conventional side of the business, the Company drilled 21 (20.1 net) wells in the year consisting of 18 (17.5 net) producing wells, two (1.6 net) injection wells and one (1.0 net) uneconomic well. Highlights from our 2024 drilling program include:\n\nAt Nipisi, we executed our third successful winter program consisting of three (3.0 net) new drills. These wells began production at the end of the first quarter, and delivered IP90 rates of approximately 225 boe/d per well. After producing for nearly a full year, these wells continue to exceed our initial expectations, with current combined production of approximately 540 boe/d;\n\nIn our Alderson, Alberta area, near Brooks, Alberta, we continued with successful multi-lateral Ellerslie oil drilling. Five (5.0 net) wells were drilled with the per-well average exceeding 300 boe/d over their initial 90 days of production. One (1.0 net) well was considered uneconomic and not completed;\n\nWe drilled five (5.0 net) wells into our Buffalo Clearwater development during 2024. The program was very successful with these wells averaging 140 bbl/d of heavy oil each over their first 120 days of production; and\n\nAt Elmworth, in northwest Alberta, we drilled two (2.0 net) Dunvegan wells, extending our development to the southwest. These wells came on early in the fall and each averaged approximately 225 boe/d over their first 90 days.\n\nSaskatchewan Thermal Project Summary and Update\n\nIn 2024, Cardinal continued to advance our Reford, Saskatchewan SAGD project which, upon completion is expected to produce approximately 6,000 bbl/d (100% heavy crude oil). The initial construction, commissioning, and warm-up phases of the project are expected to be completed prior to the end of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, the Company invested $74.3 million of expenditures directly related to the Reford project which included in shop facility construction, site preparation and water disposal wells. Cardinal also deployed approximately $9 million of SAGD expenditures to de-risk and expand future projects through land and seismic acquisition, a four (4.0 net) stratigraphic test well program and other indirect costs.\n\nModular components started to be moved out to the site in the first quarter of 2025 and will continue to be transported through the first half of 2025. In the first quarter, the following has been completed at Reford:\n\nTwo of three steam generators have been delivered to the Reford facility site;\n\n50% of the facility tankage is now on lease;\n\nDrilling of the six initial well pairs is over halfway complete and we expect all the wells will be completed early in the second quarter;\n\nConstruction of the 18 kilometer water source pipeline and 10 kilometer fuel gas supply line are now well underway with the completion of both projects forecasted before the end of April; and\n\nCardinal's thermal team continues to be expanded as we have hired over half of the planned field operations team and they are contributing to the ongoing development of the Reford project as we plan for third quarter 2025 start-up.\n\nThe Reford project continues to be executed and developed as we forecasted with costs and timeframe tracking to our initial plan and budget.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\")\n\nCardinal continued our CO 2 sequestration in Saskatchewan during 2024. Through our Carbon Capture and Sequestration (\"CCS\") enhanced oil recovery (\"EOR\") operation at Midale, the Company sequestered approximately 181,000 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent during 2024. To date, the Midale CCS EOR project has sequestered 5.8 million tonnes of CO 2 and has contributed to annual oil production decline rates from this project of approximately 3%.\n\nCardinal's safety record continues to be in the top tier of the industry, as is our regulatory compliance level.\n\nIn 2024, Cardinal continued its commitment to responsible, sustainable operations, spending $10.2 million on asset retirement activities. Cardinal participated in the abandonment of more than 55 gross wells, 128 kilometers of pipelines, and one facility during 2024. Cardinal also received 55 reclamation certificates in the year. These liability reduction activities, and associated spending, exceeded all regulatory requirements for the year.\n\nOutlook\n\nCardinal continues to work to improve its business. Our goals are to continually improve the quality and sustainability of our assets, which serves to lower the break-even costs of our operations, while also extending asset duration.\n\nOur conventional oil business continues to deliver solid, consistent results which allow us to undertake long lead time projects like our Reford thermal project. Because of the modest sustaining capital requirements of our low decline asset base, Cardinal generates significant, predictable free cash flow that we anticipate will continue to grow with our identified pipeline of conventional and thermal opportunities.\n\n2025 is a pivotal year for the Company. Once the Reford thermal project is brought on to full production in early 2026, we feel that Cardinal will be able to fund future thermal projects from internally generated cash flows. As well as self-funding additional growth, our overall corporate health will significantly improve as our dividend becomes more sustainable at lower commodity prices. Our long-term goal is to build Cardinal into a Company that can not only provide predictable shareholder returns through unforeseen global events, but to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from this disruption.\n\nGiven WTI crude oil prices have averaged over US$70 year-to-date, which continues to be ahead of our 2025 budget marker, our original capital and production guidance remains unchanged at this juncture. Management appreciates recent market and oil price volatility brought forth by North American tariff uncertainty, and will consider necessary changes to our outlook should the implications have a meaningful effect on Cardinal's business.\n\nIn addition to utilizing hedging to mitigate risk to our financial outlook, we have also completed two debenture offerings raising a total of $105 million which carry term of five years. Longer term debt provides Cardinal with more sustainability through the cyclical nature of the oil and gas business. By balancing our debt between our current bank facilities and these longer-term debt instruments, it will allow us more flexibility to further develop long lead time projects like our Reford thermal project.\n\nWe are excited about the future of our Company. As we further develop a pipeline of growth projects, we look forward to enhanced returns for shareholders through debt repayment, responsible growth, an attractive and sustainable dividend, and opportunistic share repurchases.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, Management and Employees, we would like to thank our shareholders as we appreciate their continued support.\n\nANNUAL FILINGS\n\nCardinal also announces the filing of its Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 and related Management's Discussion and Analysis with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca (\"SEDAR+\"). In addition, Cardinal will file its Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2024 on SEDAR+ on or prior to March 31, 2025. Electronic copies may be obtained on Cardinal's website at www.cardinalenergy.ca and on Cardinal's SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively \"forward-looking information\") within the meaning of applicable securities laws relating to Cardinal's plans and other aspects of Cardinal's anticipated future operations, management focus, objectives, strategies, financial, operating and production results.

Netback per boe is calculated as netback divided by total production for the applicable period. The following table details the calculation of netback per boe:\n\n\n\n\n\nThree months ended\n\n\n\nYear ended\n\n\n\nDec 31, 2024\n\n\n\nDec 31, 2023\n\n\n\nDec 31, 2024\n\n\n\nDec 31, 2023 Petroleum and natural gas revenue\n\n73.29\n\n\n\n72.60\n\n\n\n75.95\n\n\n\n74.43\n\nRoyalties\n\n(14.07 )\n\n(14.62 )\n\n(14.27 )\n\n(14.22 ) Net operating expenses\n\n(22.76 )\n\n(23.19 )\n\n(24.23 )\n\n(24.31 ) Transportation expenses\n\n(1.21 )\n\n(1.10 )\n\n(1.10 )\n\n(1.00 ) Netback per boe\n\n35.25\n\n\n\n33.69\n\n\n\n36.35\n\n\n\n34.90\n\nNet debt to adjusted funds flow ratio\n\nCardinal utilizes net debt to adjusted funds flow to measure the Company's overall debt position and to measure the strength of the Company's balance sheet. Cardinal monitors this ratio and uses this as a key measure in making decisions regarding financing, capital expenditures and shareholder returns. Net debt to adjusted funds flow is calculated as net debt divided by annualized adjusted funds flow for the applicable period.\n\nTotal payout ratio\n\nCardinal utilizes this ratio as key measure to assess the Company's ability to fund financing activities, operating activities, and capital expenditures. Total payout ratio is calculated as the sum of dividends declared plus development capital expenditures divided by adjusted funds flow.\n\nNet operating expenses per boe\n\nCardinal utilizes net operating expenses per boe to assess Cardinal's operating efficiency of its petroleum and natural gas assets on a per unit of production basis. Net operating expense per boe is calculated as net operating expenses divided by total production for the applicable period.\n\nAdjusted funds flow per boe\n\nCardinal utilizes adjusted funds flow per boe as a measure to assess the ability of the Company to generate the funds necessary for financing activities, operating activities, capital expenditures and shareholder returns on a per boe basis. Adjusted funds flow per boe is calculated using adjusted funds flow divided by total production for the applicable period.\n\nAdjusted funds flow per basic share\n\nCardinal utilizes adjusted funds flow per share as a measure to assess the ability of the Company to generate the funds necessary for financing activities, operating activities, capital expenditures and shareholder returns on a per basic share basis. Adjusted funds flow per basic share is calculated using adjusted funds flow divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding.\n\nAdjusted funds flow per diluted share\n\nCardinal utilizes adjusted funds flow per share as a measure to assess the ability of the Company to generate the funds necessary for financing activities, operating activities, capital expenditures and shareholder returns on a per diluted share basis. Adjusted funds flow per diluted share is calculated using adjusted funds flow divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\n\nSupplementary Financial Measures\n\nNI 52-112 defines a supplementary financial measure as a financial measure that: (i) is, or is intended to be, disclosed on a periodic basis to depict the historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flow of an entity; (ii) is not disclosed in the financial statements of the entity; (iii) is not a non-GAAP financial measure; and (iv) is not a non-GAAP ratio. The supplementary financial measures used in this news release are either a per unit disclosure of a corresponding GAAP measure, or a component of a corresponding GAAP measure, presented in the financial statements. Supplementary financial measures that are disclosed on a per unit basis are calculated by dividing the aggregate GAAP measure (or component thereof) by the applicable unit for the period. Supplementary financial measures that are disclosed on a component basis of a corresponding GAAP measure are a granular representation of a financial statement line item and are determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOil and Gas Metrics\n\nThe term \"boe\" or barrels of oil equivalent may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Additionally, given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil, as compared to natural gas, is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1; utilizing a conversion ratio of 6:1 may be misleading as an indication of value.\n\nInitial Production\n\nAny references in this news release to initial production rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however, such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will continue production and decline thereafter. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for Cardinal.\n\nMarket, Independent Third Party and Industry Data\n\nCertain market, independent third party and industry data, including for comparison purposes, contained in this news release is based upon information from government or other independent industry publications and reports or based on estimates derived from such publications and reports. Government and industry publications and reports generally indicate that they have obtained their information from sources believed to be reliable, but Cardinal has not conducted its own independent verification of such information. This news release also includes certain data derived from independent third parties. While Cardinal believes this data to be reliable, market and industry data is subject to variations and cannot be verified with complete certainty due to limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey. Cardinal has not independently verified any of the data from independent third-party sources referred to in this news release or ascertained the underlying assumptions relied upon by such sources.\n\nAbout Cardinal Energy Ltd.\n\nCardinal is a Canadian oil and natural gas company with operations focused on low decline oil in Western Canada.

                "text": "Listen to this story:\n\nReprocessing single-use devices (SUDs) can save U.S. hospitals over $412 million annually while reducing environmental impact.\n\nCardiovascular reprocessing, particularly in Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) procedures, cuts costs by nearly 30% without compromising patient safety.\n\nA new partnership between Cardinal Health and Innovative Health enhances cardiology device reprocessing, providing hospitals with significant financial and environmental benefits.\n\nU.S. hospitals are adopting medical device reprocessing as a key strategy to cut costs, reduce waste, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions. Cardinal Health’s Sustainable Technologies™ division is leading this shift, offering single-use device (SUD) collections and reprocessing services. In 2021, hospitals saved over $412 million through these efforts, according to the Association of Medical Device Reprocessors.\n\nReprocessing and the Circular Economy\n\n“With patient safety at the forefront, leveraging a single-use device reprocessing program helps hospitals properly extend the life of a medical device and contribute to a stronger circular economy,” said Meg McClanahan, Global Portfolio Director of Sustainable Technologies. The healthcare sector, a major contributor to waste, is increasingly focused on sustainability, aiming to reduce its projected six gigatons of annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nHistorically, the sector relied on a linear model, prioritizing single-use devices for infection control. However, advancements in reprocessing technology now allow many of these devices to be safely reused, drastically cutting down waste.\n\n“Over the last 20 years, reprocessed devices have been proven to function equivalent to new devices and represent no additional patient risk – thanks to strict oversight and additional regulations put in place by the FDA,” McClanahan added.\n\nCost-Effective Cardiology Reprocessing\n\nThe cardiology sector is seeing rapid growth in procedures like Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) treatments, which are costly due to the advanced devices used. Reprocessing these devices offers substantial savings. Using reprocessed SUDs in AFib procedures can reduce costs by nearly 30%, translating to over $3,000 in savings per procedure.\n\nTo enhance their cardiology offerings, Cardinal Health’s Sustainable Technologies has partnered with Innovative Health, a leader in the reprocessing of cardiology devices. “The success and reputation of Sustainable Technologies in the reprocessing industry demonstrates Cardinal Health’s commitment to doing the right thing for patients, hospitals and the environment,” said Rick Ferreira, CEO of Innovative Health. This collaboration expands Sustainable Technologies’ portfolio, including nearly 50 FDA-cleared cardiology devices, and opens up new savings opportunities for hospitals.\n\nExpanding Reprocessing Capabilities\n\nInnovative Health, founded by reprocessing pioneers in 2015, aims to help electrophysiology labs reduce costs and adopt new technologies. McClanahan noted, “Working with an industry leader like Innovative Health represents a significant strengthening of our reprocessing offering and our ability to drive cost savings. Innovative Health has built the industry’s strongest portfolio in cardiology device reprocessing.”\n\nHospitals enrolled in this partnership can now access a comprehensive portfolio of reprocessed cardiology devices, potentially saving hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nRelated Article: Prime Healthcare Hospitals Named to the 2022 Fortune/Merative 100 Top Hospitals List\n\nLooking Ahead: A Sustainable Healthcare Future\n\nAs members of the Association of Medical Device Reprocessors, both Sustainable Technologies and Innovative Health advocate for the growth and standardization of reprocessing practices. “At Cardinal Health, we believe that reprocessing will be increasingly important to healthcare customers to help reduce costs and drive sustainability goals, so it’s a real win-win,” said Megan Maltenfort, Vice President of Environmental, Social, and Governance at Cardinal Health.\n\nCardinal Health’s ongoing commitment to sustainability and cost-efficiency aims to position it as the most trusted partner in healthcare, offering robust solutions to meet the evolving needs of hospitals and patients.",

Adjusted funds flow for the third quarter was negatively impacted by the lower West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) oil price which decreased 7% from the second quarter average.\n\nAverage production for the third quarter of 2024 was 3% lower than the same period in 2023 as planned Company owned and unplanned third-party facility turnarounds impacted the third quarter production by approximately 500 boe/d. In addition, Cardinal continues to temporarily curtail low netback natural gas production of approximately 250 boe/d as a result of current natural gas prices. Cardinal anticipates bringing this production back on-stream when it is economically prudent to do so. The low-decline nature of our asset base and optimization efforts through 2024 continued to contribute to Cardinal’s top decile base decline rate.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, net operating expenses per boe slightly increased by 1% over the same period in 2023, due to additional turnaround costs and higher carbon taxes, partially offset by decreased power prices.\n\nWe have maintained a strong financial position with prudent financial management and a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Cardinal’s net debt closed the third quarter of 2024 at $119.2 million, an increase of $20 million over the prior quarter. The increase in net debt was forecasted during the quarter with a planned active drilling program combined with the ramp-up of the SAGD project. As at September 30, Cardinal was drawn 35% on its current $200 million credit facility. The Company’s net debt to adjusted funds flow ratio remained low at 0.5x.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company spent $33.2 million on development capital expenditures which included the drilling and completion of ten (9.3 net) wells as detailed below. Cardinal also spent $2.6 million on recompletions and workovers and continued with the enhanced oil recovery program of CO 2 injection at Midale which continues to enhance our low decline production profile.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Cardinal spent $21.5 million on exploration and evaluation expenditures related to our Saskatchewan SAGD projects. To date in 2024, the Company has incurred $48.4 million on exploration and evaluation. As detailed below, the Reford project continues to track to our forecasted timeline and cost estimate.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN THERMAL PROJECT UPDATE\n\nCardinal’s planned 6,000 bbl/d SAGD project at Reford, Saskatchewan remains on schedule and on budget with completion of the initial development phase expected prior to the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Cardinal invested $21.5 million in the Reford SAGD project. Significant progress was achieved on multiple fronts of the project including:\n\nEarthworks substantially completed;\n\nSite piling started and ongoing;\n\nModular facility fabrication ongoing and on schedule, first modules expected on site in the fourth quarter of 2024;\n\nWater source testing complete with pipelining scheduled to start in the first quarter of 2025;\n\nInitial SAGD well pairs finalized, drilling to begin in the first quarter of 2025; and\n\nOperations team buildout ongoing.\n\nOn a percentage spent basis, the project is approximately 30% complete at the end of the third quarter of 2024 with initial steam expected in the third quarter of 2025. We continue to track to budget on both costs and timeline.\n\nDelineation work on the potential second SAGD project at Kelfield is continuing with additional 3D seismic acquired during the quarter and with additional stratigraphic test wells planned for the fourth quarter of 2024, work is ongoing to assess potential source water resources for the project.\n\nDRILLING OPERATIONS UPDATE\n\nAs budgeted, the third quarter conventional drilling program was the busiest of the year but added a modest amount of production as the new wells came on late in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter. Planned development drilling activity was completed across our asset base with ten (9.3 net) wells drilled across our asset base and detailed as follows:\n\nTwo (2.0 net) light oil wells in our Northern Alberta Elmworth area were drilled and brought on stream, on type curve;\n\nThree (2.3 net) wells drilled at our Southeast Saskatchewan Midale field consisting of two injectors and one producer are currently being optimized;\n\nThree (3.0 net) heavy oil wells drilled on our Central Alberta Buffalo Clearwater equivalent project with two on stream at expectation and one currently continuing to clean-up;\n\nOne (1.0 net) well drilled on our Central Alberta Wainwright Rex project is currently recovering load oil; and\n\nOne (1.0 net) Ellerslie oil well drilled at Tide Lake in Southern Alberta. This was the first of a three (3.0 net) well program. With the second and third wells drilled in October, all three of these wells are just coming on production.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”)\n\nCardinal continued our CO 2 sequestration activities in Saskatchewan, with approximately 29,500 tonnes sequestered during the third quarter of 2024. As part of our enhanced oil recovery operation at Midale, Saskatchewan, 5.7 million tonnes of CO 2 have been sequestered here. This has helped to reduce annual oil production decline rates within this project to approximately 3%.\n\nCardinal’s safety record continues to be in the top tier of the industry, as is our regulatory compliance level.\n\nDuring the first nine months of 2024 Cardinal deployed almost $7 million towards abandonment and reclamation activities, continuing with our proactive approach to reducing liabilities and the environmental footprint of our asset base. We remain on track to exceed our regulatory spend requirements for 2024.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nThe third quarter of 2024 continued to demonstrate the strength of Cardinal’s low-decline asset base enabling us to deploy capital into our first SAGD project. As forecasted, our third quarter drilling program added a modest amount of production to quarterly volumes and despite the curtailment of approximately 250 boe/d of natural gas production and facility turnarounds, our low-decline asset base continued to maintain our production.\n\nCardinal will continue to pursue projects and opportunities that increase our sustainability and decrease our corporate risk. The Company’s commitment to the Reford SAGD project will be fundamental in extending corporate reserve life and enhancing long-term sustainability. The project continues to progress on schedule and on budget. Capital for the remainder of 2024 will be focused on continuing advancement of the Reford project.\n\nIn addition to the development of the Reford SAGD project, Cardinal continued to build both on its successful 2024 development program across its conventional asset base and is progressing the development of our second planned SAGD project south of Reford at Kelfield, Saskatchewan. Volumes from the third quarter drilling program are expected to increase our production to over 22,000 boe/d.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, management and employees, Cardinal would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support.\n\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively “forward-looking information”) within the meaning of applicable securities laws relating to Cardinal’s plans and other aspects of Cardinal’s anticipated future operations, management focus, objectives, strategies, financial, operating and production results.

The Company discloses crude oil production based on the pricing index that the oil is priced from. The following table is intended to provide the product type composition as defined by NI 51-101.\n\nLight/Medium Crude Oil Heavy Oil NGL Conventional Natural Gas Total (boe/d) Q3/2024 46% 40% 4% 10% 21,128 Q3/2023 45% 39% 4% 12% 21,872 9 months/2024 48% 37% 4% 11% 21,730 9 months/2023 46% 38% 4% 12% 21,549 Q3 Turnaround impact 39% 32% 7% 22% 500 Q4/2024 estimates 46% 40% 4% 10% ~22,000\n\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\n\nThis news release contains certain specified measures consisting of non-GAAP financial measures, capital management measures, non-GAAP financial ratios, and supplementary financial measures. Since these specified financial measures may not have a standardized meaning, they must be clearly defined and, where required, reconciled with their nearest GAAP measure and may not be comparable with the calculation of similar financial measures disclosed by other entities.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nNet operating expenses\n\nNet operating expenses is calculated as operating expense less processing and other revenue primarily generated by processing third party volumes at processing facilities where the Company has an ownership interest, and can be expressed on a per boe basis. As the Company’s principal business is not that of a midstream entity, management believes this is a useful supplemental measure to reflect the true cash outlay at its processing facilities by utilizing spare capacity to process third party volumes. The following table reconciles operating expenses to net operating expenses:\n\nThree months ended Nine months ended Sept 30, 2024 Sept 30, 2023 Sept 30, 2024 Sept 30, 2023 Operating expenses 48,752 49,404 151,380 148,518 Less: Processing and other revenue (1,330 ) (913 ) (4,140 ) (3,185 ) Net operating expenses 47,422 48,491 147,240 145,333\n\nNetback\n\nCardinal utilizes netback as key performance indicator and is utilized by Cardinal to better analyze the operating performance of its petroleum and natural gas assets against prior periods. Netback is calculated as petroleum and natural gas revenue deducted by royalties, net operating expenses, and transportation expenses. The following table reconciles petroleum and natural gas revenue to netback:\n\nThree months ended Nine months ended Sept 30, 2024 Sept 30, 2023 Sept 30, 2024 Sept 30, 2023 Petroleum and natural gas revenue 147,991 169,533 457,570 441,563 Royalties (28,369 ) (31,503 ) (85,370 ) (82,812 ) Net operating expenses (47,422 ) (48,491 ) (147,240 ) (145,333 ) Transportation expenses (1,787 ) (1,887 ) (6,306 ) (5,707 ) Netback 70,413 87,652 218,654 207,711\n\n\n\nCapital expenditures and development capital expenditures\n\nCardinal utilizes capital expenditures as a measure of capital investment on property, plant and equipment compared to the annual budgeted capital expenditure. Capital expenditures is calculated as cash flow from investing activities excluding change in non-cash working capital and exploration and evaluation. Cardinal utilizes development capital expenditures as a measure of capital investment on property, plant and equipment excluding capitalized G&A, other assets, net acquisitions and is compared to the annual budgeted capital expenditures. Other capital expenditures include capitalized G&A and office expenditures.\n\nThe following table reconciles cash flow from investing activities to total capital expenditures to total development capital expenditures:\n\nThree months ended Nine months ended Sept 30, 2024 Sept 30, 2023 Sept 30, 2024 Sept 30, 2023 Cash flow from investing activities 45,402 18,608 123,747 75,495 Change in non-cash working capital 10,023 11,881 11,019 1,036 Exploration and evaluation (21,533 ) (217 ) (48,415 ) (575 ) Capital expenditures 33,892 30,272 86,351 75,956 Less: Capitalized G&A (296 ) (458 ) (1,273 ) (1,632 ) Other (439 ) (164 ) (788 ) (448 ) Acquisitions, net – (1,558 ) – 7,570 Development capital expenditures 33,157 28,092 84,290 81,446\n\nAdjusted working capital deficiency\n\nManagement utilizes adjusted working capital to monitor its capital structure, liquidity, and its ability to fund current operations. Adjusted working capital is calculated as current liabilities less current assets (adjusted for the fair value of financial instruments, current decommissioning obligation, and current lease liabilities). The following table reconciles working capital to adjusted working capital:\n\nAs at Sept 30, 2024 Sept 30, 2023 Working capital deficiency 60,706 25,342 Lease liabilities (1,635 ) (1,366 ) Decommissioning obligation (8,903 ) (6,811 ) Fair value of financial instruments, net (128 ) 695 Adjusted working capital deficiency 50,040 17,860\n\nNet debt\n\nManagement utilizes net debt to analyze the financial position, liquidity and leverage of Cardinal. Net debt is calculated as bank debt plus adjusted working capital.\n\nThe following table reconciles bank debt to net debt:\n\nAs at Sept 30, 2024 Sept 30, 2023 Bank debt 69,134 44,106 Adjusted working capital deficiency / (surplus) 50,040 17,860 Net debt 119,174 61,966\n\nFunds flow\n\nManagement utilizes funds flow as a useful measure of Cardinal’s ability to generate cash not subject to short-term movements in non-cash operating working capital. As shown below, funds flow is calculated as cash flow from operating activities excluding the change in non-cash working capital.\n\nAdjusted funds flow\n\nManagement utilizes adjusted funds flow as a key measure to assess the ability of the Company to generate the funds necessary for financing activities, operating activities, capital expenditures and shareholder returns. As shown below, adjusted funds flow is calculated as funds flow excluding decommissioning expenditures since Cardinal believes the timing of payment or incurrence of these items involves a high degree of discretion and variability. Expenditures on decommissioning obligations vary from period to period depending on the maturity of the Company’s operating areas and availability of adjusted funds flow and are viewed as part of the Company’s capital budgeting process.\n\nFree cash flow\n\nManagement utilizes free cash flow as a measure to assess Cardinal’s ability to generate cash, after taking into account the development capital expenditures, to increase returns to shareholders, repay debt, or for other corporate purposes. As shown below, free cash flow is calculated as adjusted funds flow less development capital expenditures.\n\nThe following table reconciles cash flow from operating activities, funds flow, adjusted funds flow, and free cash flow:\n\nThree months ended Nine months ended Sept 30, 2024 Sept 30, 2023 Sept 30, 2024 Sept 30, 2023 Cash flow from operating activities 83,635 58,647 194,462 160,956 Change in non-cash working capital (19,073 ) 17,222 (1,032 ) 14,582 Funds flow 64,562 75,869 193,430 175,538 Decommissioning expenditures 1,162 5,361 6,927 14,192 Adjusted funds flow 65,724 81,230 200,357 189,730 Total development capital expenditures (33,157 ) (28,092 ) (84,290 ) (81,446 ) Free cash flow 32,567 53,138 116,067 108,284\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Ratios\n\nNetback per boe\n\nCardinal utilizes operating netback per boe to assess the Company’s operating performance of its petroleum and natural gas assets on a per unit of production basis. Netback per boe is calculated as netback divided by total production for the applicable period. The following table details the calculation of netback per boe:\n\nThree months ended Nine months ended Sept 30, 2024 Sept 30, 2023 Sept 30, 2024 Sept 30, 2023 Petroleum and natural gas revenue 76.14 84.25 76.85 75.06 Royalties (14.60 ) (15.66 ) (14.34 ) (14.08 ) Net operating expenses (24.40 ) (24.10 ) (24.73 ) (24.70 ) Transportation expenses (0.92 ) (0.94 ) (1.06 ) (0.97 ) Netback per boe 36.22 43.55 36.72 35.31\n\nNet debt to adjusted funds flow ratio\n\nCardinal utilizes net debt to adjusted funds flow to measure the Company’s overall debt position and to measure the strength of the Company’s balance sheet. Cardinal monitors this ratio and uses this as a key measure in making decisions regarding financing, capital expenditures and shareholder returns. Net debt to adjusted funds flow is calculated as net debt divided by the adjusted funds flow for the trailing twelve month period.\n\nTotal payout ratio\n\nCardinal utilizes this ratio as key measure to assess the Company’s ability to fund financing activities, operating activities, and capital expenditures. Total payout ratio is calculated as the sum of dividends declared plus development capital expenditures divided by adjusted funds flow trailing twelve-month period.\n\nNet operating expenses per boe\n\nCardinal utilizes net operating expenses per boe to assess Cardinal’s operating efficiency of its petroleum and natural gas assets on a per unit of production basis. Net operating expense per boe is calculated as net operating expenses divided by total production for the applicable period.\n\nAdjusted funds flow per boe\n\nCardinal utilizes adjusted funds flow per boe as a measure to assess the ability of the Company to generate the funds necessary for financing activities, operating activities, capital expenditures and shareholder returns on a per boe basis. Adjusted funds flow per boe is calculated using adjusted funds flow divided by total production for the applicable period.\n\nAdjusted funds flow per basic share\n\nCardinal utilizes adjusted funds flow per share as a measure to assess the ability of the Company to generate the funds necessary for financing activities, operating activities, capital expenditures and shareholder returns on a per basic share basis. Adjusted funds flow per basic share is calculated using adjusted funds flow divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding.\n\nAdjusted funds flow per diluted share\n\nCardinal utilizes adjusted funds flow per share as a measure to assess the ability of the Company to generate the funds necessary for financing activities, operating activities, capital expenditures and shareholder returns on a per diluted share basis. Adjusted funds flow per diluted share is calculated using adjusted funds flow divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\n\nSupplementary Financial Measures\n\nNI 52-112 defines a supplementary financial measure as a financial measure that: (i) is, or is intended to be, disclosed on a periodic basis to depict the historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flow of an entity; (ii) is not disclosed in the financial statements of the entity; (iii) is not a non-GAAP financial measure; and (iv) is not a non-GAAP ratio. The supplementary financial measures used in this news release are either a per unit disclosure of a corresponding GAAP measure, or a component of a corresponding GAAP measure, presented in the financial statements. Supplementary financial measures that are disclosed on a per unit basis are calculated by dividing the aggregate GAAP measure (or component thereof) by the applicable unit for the period. Supplementary financial measures that are disclosed on a component basis of a corresponding GAAP measure are a granular representation of a financial statement line item and are determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOil and Gas Metrics\n\nThe term “boe” or barrels of oil equivalent may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Additionally, given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil, as compared to natural gas, is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1; utilizing a conversion ratio of 6:1 may be misleading as an indication of value.\n\nThe term “Payout” means the revenue from production from a well required to fully pay for the drilling, completion, equipping and tie-in of such well.\n\nMarket, Independent Third Party and Industry Data\n\nCardinal may use certain market, independent third party and industry data in respect of comparisons of Cardinal to certain peer entities, including as it relates to its decline rates, which data is based upon information from public sources, including as reported by such entities and other government or other independent industry publications and reports or based on estimates derived from such publications and reports. Cardinal has not conducted its own independent verification of such information. While Cardinal believes this data to be reliable, third party, market and industry data is subject to variations and cannot be verified with complete certainty due to limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey. Cardinal had not independently verified any of the data from independent third party sources or ascertained the underlying assumptions relied upon by such sources.\n\nAbout Cardinal Energy Ltd.\n\nCardinal is a Canadian oil and natural gas company with operations focused on low decline oil in Western Canada. Cardinal differentiates itself from its peers by having the lowest decline conventional asset base in Western Canada. Cardinal has recently announced the commencement of its first thermal SAGD oil development project which will further increase the long-term sustainability of the Company.\n\nFor further information:\n\nM.

                "text": "Calgary, Alberta–(Newsfile Corp. – August 1, 2024) – Cardinal Energy Ltd. (TSX: CJ) (“Cardinal” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce its operating and financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nFINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2024\n\nAverage production volumes of 22,376 boe/d were 3% higher than the first quarter of 2024, despite shutting in 250 boe/d of subeconomic natural gas, as volumes from the Company’s strong first quarter drilling program positively impacted the quarter;\n\nAdjusted funds flow(1) increased 55% over the first quarter of 2024 due to increased production, stronger oil prices and reduced net operating expenses;\n\nOil production increased 5%; Cardinal realized oil prices increased 17%; Net operating expenses (1) per boe decreased 10%;\n\n\n\nSecond quarter adjusted funds flow of $81.8 million was allocated as follows:\n\nNet debt (1) reduction – 25%; Exploration and evaluation growth capital – 13%; Capital expenditures to maintain production – 24%; Asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) – 2%; Shareholder returns (dividends) – 36%;\n\n\n\nDecreased net debt by 17% over the prior quarter to close the second quarter at $99.2 million leading to a net debt to adjusted funds flow ratio (1) of 0.4x. At the end of the second quarter, Cardinal was drawn 39% on its recently expanded $200 million credit facility;\n\nof 0.4x. At the end of the second quarter, Cardinal was drawn 39% on its recently expanded $200 million credit facility; Production from seven wells drilled in the first quarter of 2024 added 1,980 boe/d to second quarter 2024 production; and\n\nDevelopment capital expenditures(1) were $18.8 million which included one (0.8 net) well drilled at Midale, Saskatchewan and recompletions and reactivations across our asset base. Exploration and evaluation expenditures of $10.8 million were spent on our Saskatchewan steam assisted gravity drainage (“SAGD”) projects.\n\n(1) See non-GAAP and other financial measures.\n\nThe following table summarizes our second quarter financial and operating highlights:\n\n($000’s except shares, per share\n\nand operating amounts) Three months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30 2024 2023 % Chg 2024 2023 % Chg Financial Petroleum and natural gas revenue 169,353 137,053 24 309,579 272,030 14 Cash flow from operating activities 71,463 61,220 17 110,827 102,309 8 Adjusted funds flow (1) 81,827 56,190 46 134,633 108,500 24 per share – basic 0.51 0.35 46 0.85 0.69 24 per share – diluted 0.51 0.35 46 0.84 0.68 22 Earnings / (Loss) 40,650 27,719 47 57,401 44,040 30 per share – basic 0.26 0.18 44 0.36 0.28 29 per share – diluted 0.25 0.17 47 0.36 0.28 29 Development capital expenditures (1) 18,759 29,867 (37) 51,133 53,354 (4) Other capital expenditures (1) 758 490 55 1,326 1,458 (9) Property acquisitions, net – (10,000) (100) – (9,128) (100) Capital expenditures 19,517 20,357 (4) 52,459 45,684 15 Exploration & evaluation expenditures 10,814 10,400 4% 26,882 10,400 158 Common shares, net of treasury shares (000s) 159,178 158,513 – 159,178 158,513 – Dividends declared 29,116 29,058 – 58,151 57,800 1 Per share 0.18 0.18 – 0.36 0.36 – Total Payout ratio (1) 59% 105% (44) 81% 102% (21) Bank debt 77,904 53,158 47 Adjusted working capital deficiency(1) 21,313 23,111 (8) Net debt (1) 99,217 76,269 30 Net debt to adjusted fund flow ratio (1) 0.4 0.3 33 Operating Average daily production Light oil (bbl/d) 7,516 7,651 (2) 7,397 7,736 (4) Medium/heavy oil (bbl/d) 11,757 10,034 17 11,396 10,206 12 NGL (bbl/d) 811 689 18 832 775 7 Conventional natural gas (mcf/d) 13,752 16,038 (14) 14,453 16,009 (10) Total (boe/d) 22,376 21,047 6 22,034 21,385 3 Netback ($/boe) (1) Petroleum and natural gas revenue 83.17 71.56 16 77.20 70.28 10 Royalties (15.33) (13.35) 15 (14.21) (13.26) 7 Net operating expenses (1) (23.65) (24.63) (4) (24.89) (25.02) (1) Transportation expenses (1.15) (1.07) 7 (1.13) (0.99) 14 Netback (1) 43.04 32.51 32 36.97 31.01 19 Realized gain/(loss) on commodity contracts (0.02) – n/m 0.02 0.39 (95) Interest and other (0.18) (0.82) (78) (0.63) (0.74) (15) G&A (2.66) (2.35) 13 (2.78) (2.63) 6 Adjusted funds flow (1) 40.18 29.34 37 33.58 28.03 20\n\n(1) See non-GAAP and other financial measures.\n\nn/m – Not meaningful or not calculable\n\nSECOND QUARTER OVERVIEW\n\nAdjusted funds flow for the second quarter of 2024 was $81.8 million ($0.51 per basic and diluted share) compared to $52.8 million in the first quarter of 2024 ($0.33 per basic and diluted share). Adjusted funds flow for the second quarter was positively impacted by increased oil production, higher average oil prices, and lower net operating expenses.\n\nAverage production for the second quarter of 2024 was 3% higher than the previous quarter and 6% higher than the second quarter of 2023. The low-decline nature of our asset base and optimization efforts through the first half of 2024 continued to contribute to Cardinal’s top decile base decline rate. The Company’s successful first quarter 2024 drilling program added 1,980 boe/d from seven wells to second quarter production allowing the Company to reduce its 2024 capital program by a previously announced $16 million. During the second quarter, Cardinal temporarily curtailed low netback natural gas production of approximately 250 boe/d as a result of current natural gas prices. Cardinal anticipates bringing this production back on-stream when it is economically prudent to do so.\n\nCardinal experienced robust revenue growth in the second quarter driven by increased oil production levels and higher oil pricing. In the second quarter of 2024, a 5% increase in West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) oil prices combined with Western Canadian Select (“WCS”) differentials narrowing by 30% to average US$13.61/bbl, resulted in a 21% increase in revenue in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter.\n\nNet operating expenses per boe decreased 10% in the second quarter to $23.65/boe compared to $26.17/boe in the first quarter of 2024 and were 4% lower than the same period in 2023. Net operating expenses were lower in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter due to higher production and lower Alberta power prices and usage combined with lower workover and well servicing costs. During the second quarter of 2024, Alberta power prices decreased over 50% compared to the prior quarter while consumption decreased by approximately 10% over the heavy usage winter months as experienced in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWe have maintained a strong financial position with prudent financial management and a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Cardinal’s net debt closed the second quarter of 2024 at $99.2 million, a decrease of 17% over the prior quarter. During the second quarter, the Company renewed its credit facility which was increased to $200 million with an additional lender and will support the future development of our SAGD project. At the end of the second quarter, Cardinal was drawn $77.9 million or 39% of the available limits on the credit facility. The Company’s net debt to adjusted funds flow ratio remained low at 0.4x. During the second quarter, Cardinal allocated our adjusted funds flow with 25% to net debt reduction, 13% to SAGD capital for future production growth, 24% allocated to production maintenance capital, 2% to ARO and 36% to direct shareholder returns with our monthly dividend.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Company’s development program was focused on recompletions and reactivations and infrastructure upgrades across our asset base. Cardinal spent $18.8 million on development capital expenditures which included drilling one (0.8 net) well at Midale late in the second quarter. We continued with our well reactivation program spending $4.1 million on recompletions throughout our operating areas. Cardinal also constructed new facilities and upgraded existing infrastructure across our asset base and continued with the enhanced oil recovery program with CO 2 injection at Midale with ~$750,000 spent on CO 2 purchases.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Cardinal spent $10.8 million on exploration and evaluation expenditures related to our Saskatchewan SAGD projects. To date in 2024, the Company has incurred $26.9 million on exploration and evaluation of which $25.3 million is attributable to the Reford SAGD project. The expenditures are related to ongoing facility modular components, initiation of water infrastructure projects, power generation, fuel gas pipeline infrastructure and surface preparation for the facility. The project continues to track to our forecasted timeline and cost estimate.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN THERMAL PROJECT UPDATE\n\nCardinal’s 6,000 bbl/d SAGD project at Reford, Saskatchewan remains on schedule and on budget with completion of the initial development phase expected prior to the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, Cardinal invested $25.3 million in the Reford SAGD project. Significant activities undertaken during the second quarter with this project included: fabrication of the central processing facility modular components, optimization of resource mapping, the hiring of additional project team members and ongoing community engagement initiatives.\n\nOn a dollars spent basis, the project was 15% completed by the end of the second quarter of 2024 and on a timeline basis, we are 25% complete. We continue to track to budget on both costs and timeline.\n\nKey activities planned for the remainder of 2024 include:\n\nOngoing fabrication of the central processing facility modular components;\n\nDesign and engineering of the water infrastructure required to generate steam;\n\nSAGD well pair design and placement work, including procurement of long-lead items; and\n\nCommencement of earthworks for the central processing facility and the first SAGD well pad.\n\nDRILLING OPERATIONS UPDATE\n\nAs budgeted, activity in the second quarter was moderate with one (0.8 net) well drilled during the quarter at Midale which is expected to be onstream in the third quarter. Currently, Cardinal has two rigs active, drilling in the Midale and Elmworth areas.\n\nPerformance of our first quarter program continues to exceed expectations which, as previously disclosed, allowed the Company to reduce full year development capital while maintaining production guidance. Details on production performance on first quarter drilling activities is as follows:\n\nThree (3.0 net) Clearwater oil wells at Nipisi were drilled and came on-stream late in the first quarter. Current production from these wells is approximately 700 boe/d (94% heavy crude oil and 6% conventional natural gas);\n\nTwo (2.0 net) Clearwater equivalent oil wells at Buffalo Lake were drilled and came on-stream at the end of the first quarter. Current production is approximately 400 bbl/d (100% heavy crude oil). Three additional wells are planned at Buffalo Lake in the third quarter of 2024; and\n\nTwo (2.0 net) Ellerslie oil wells at Tide Lake were drilled and came on-stream midway through the first quarter. Both wells have paid out and are currently producing of approximately 1,000 boe/d (85% medium crude oil and 15% conventional natural gas) well above expectations. Three additional wells are planned for later in the year in this area.\n\nCardinal continues to focus on the efficient deployment of capital by increasing its multi-year conventional drilling inventory to complement its low-decline production base. In late Q2 the Company resumed its reduced 2024 drilling program with plans to drill 11 additional wells through 2024.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”)\n\nCardinal continued our CO 2 sequestration activities in Saskatchewan, with approximately 27,000 tonnes sequestered during the second quarter of 2024. As part of our enhanced oil recovery operation at Midale, Saskatchewan, 5.7 million tonnes of CO 2 have been sequestered here. This has helped to reduce annual oil production decline rates within this project to approximately 3%.\n\nCardinal’s safety record continues to be in the top tier of the industry, as is our regulatory compliance level.\n\nDuring the first half of 2024 Cardinal deployed almost $6 million towards abandonment and reclamation activities, continuing with our proactive approach to reducing liabilities and the environmental footprint of our asset base. We are on track to exceed our regulatory spend requirements for 2024.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nThe second quarter of 2024 continued to demonstrate the strength of Cardinal’s low-decline asset base. Despite the curtailment of approximately 250 boe/d of uneconomic natural gas production in the second quarter, production increased 3% over the prior quarter due to our low-decline asset base and strong first quarter drilling results.\n\nCardinal will continue to pursue projects and opportunities that increase our sustainability and decrease our corporate risk. The Company’s commitment to the Reford SAGD project will be fundamental in extending corporate reserve life and enhancing long-term sustainability. The project continues to progress on schedule and on budget.\n\nIn addition to the development of the Reford SAGD project, Cardinal is continuing to build both on its successful 2024 development program across its conventional asset base and is progressing the assessment of our second planned SAGD project south of Reford at Kelfield, Saskatchewan.\n\nCardinal has plans to drill 21 conventional oil wells this year:\n\nQ1/Q2: nine (8.8 net) wells were drilled;\n\nQ3/Q4: 12 (11.3 net) wells are forecasted to be drilled with production expected in early Q4 which includes: Three (3.0 net) in the southern area for Ellerslie oil; Three (3.0 net) additional Clearwater oil wells at Buffalo Lake; Three (2.3 net) Midale wells; Two (2.0 net) Elmworth Dunvegan light oil wells; and One (1.0 net) Central Alberta Mannville oil well.\n\n\n\nUnder current strip pricing, Cardinal is forecasting that adjusted funds flow for 2024 and 2025, driven by our low-decline conventional oil and gas assets, will fully fund ongoing returns to shareholders and the development of the Reford SAGD project. The execution of the Reford project expected to be fully commissioned in late 2025, will provide Cardinal with the flexibility to revisit its framework for both shareholder returns and future capital spending budgets.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, management and employees, Cardinal would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support.\n\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively “forward-looking information”) within the meaning of applicable securities laws relating to Cardinal’s plans and other aspects of Cardinal’s anticipated future operations, management focus, objectives, strategies, financial, operating and production results.

The following table is intended to provide the product type composition as defined by NI 51-101.\n\nLight/Medium Crude Oil Heavy Oil NGL Conventional Natural Gas Total (boe/d) Q1/2024 Drills – 94% – 6% 1,980 Q2/2024 48% 38% 4% 10% 22,376 Q2/2023 45% 39% 3% 13% 21,047 1H/2024 50% 35% 4% 11% 22,034 1H/2023 46% 38% 4% 12% 21,385\n\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\n\nThis news release contains certain specified measures consisting of non-GAAP financial measures, capital management measures, non-GAAP financial ratios, and supplementary financial measures. Since these specified financial measures may not have a standardized meaning, they must be clearly defined and, where required, reconciled with their nearest GAAP measure and may not be comparable with the calculation of similar financial measures disclosed by other entities.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nNet operating expenses\n\nNet operating expenses is calculated as operating expense less processing and other revenue primarily generated by processing third party volumes at processing facilities where the Company has an ownership interest, and can be expressed on a per boe basis. As the Company’s principal business is not that of a midstream entity, management believes this is a useful supplemental measure to reflect the true cash outlay at its processing facilities by utilizing spare capacity to process third party volumes. The following table reconciles operating expenses to net operating expenses:\n\nThree months ended Six months ended June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Operating expenses 49,939 48,273 102,628 99,114 Less: Processing and other revenue (1,785 ) (1,095 ) (2,810 ) (2,272 ) Net operating expenses 48,154 47,178 99,818 96,842\n\nNetback\n\nCardinal utilizes netback as key performance indicator and is utilized by Cardinal to better analyze the operating performance of its petroleum and natural gas assets against prior periods. Netback is calculated as petroleum and natural gas revenue deducted by royalties, net operating expenses, and transportation expenses. The following table reconciles petroleum and natural gas revenue to netback:\n\nThree months ended Six months ended\n\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Petroleum and natural gas revenue 169,353 137,053 309,579 272,030 Royalties (31,213 ) (25,567 ) (57,001 ) (51,309 ) Net operating expenses (48,154 ) (47,178 ) (99,818 ) (96,842 ) Transportation expenses (2,340 ) (2,047 ) (4,519 ) (3,820 ) Netback 87,646 62,261 148,241 120,059\n\nCapital expenditures and development capital expenditures\n\nCardinal utilizes capital expenditures as a measure of capital investment on property, plant and equipment compared to the annual budgeted capital expenditure. Capital expenditures is calculated as cash flow from investing activities excluding change in non-cash working capital and exploration and evaluation. Cardinal utilizes development capital expenditures as a measure of capital investment on property, plant and equipment excluding capitalized G&A, other assets, net acquisitions and is compared to the annual budgeted capital expenditures. Other capital expenditures include capitalized G&A and office expenditures. The following table reconciles cash flow from investing activities to total capital expenditures to total development capital expenditures:\n\nThree months ended Six months ended June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Cash flow from investing activities 32,507 30,825 78,344 56,887 Change in non-cash working capital (2,176 ) (10,110 ) 997 (10,845 ) Exploration and evaluation (10,814 ) (358 ) (26,882 ) (358 ) Capital expenditures 19,517 20,357 52,459 45,684 Less: Capitalized G&A (314 ) (366 ) (977 ) (1,174 ) Other (444 ) (124 ) (349 ) (284 ) Acquisitions, net – 10,000 – 9,128 Development capital expenditures 18,759 29,867 51,133 53,354\n\nAdjusted working capital deficiency\n\nManagement utilizes adjusted working capital to monitor its capital structure, liquidity, and its ability to fund current operations. Adjusted working capital is calculated as current liabilities less current assets (adjusted for the fair value of financial instruments, current decommissioning obligation, and current lease liabilities). The following table reconciles working capital to adjusted working capital:\n\nAs at June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Working capital deficiency / (surplus) 28,688 29,877 Lease liabilities (1,595 ) (1,206 ) Decommissioning obligation (7,857 ) (5,112 ) Fair value of financial instruments, net 2,077 (448 ) Adjusted working capital deficiency 21,313 23,111\n\nNet debt\n\nManagement utilizes net debt to analyze the financial position, liquidity and leverage of Cardinal. Net debt is calculated as bank debt plus adjusted working capital.\n\nThe following table reconciles bank debt to net debt:\n\nAs at June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Bank debt 77,904 53,158 Adjusted working capital deficiency / (surplus) 21,313 23,111 Net debt 99,217 76,269\n\nFunds flow\n\nManagement utilizes funds flow as a useful measure of Cardinal’s ability to generate cash not subject to short-term movements in non-cash operating working capital. As shown below, funds flow is calculated as cash flow from operating activities excluding the change in non-cash working capital.\n\nAdjusted funds flow\n\nManagement utilizes adjusted funds flow as a key measure to assess the ability of the Company to generate the funds necessary for financing activities, operating activities, capital expenditures and shareholder returns. As shown below, adjusted funds flow is calculated as funds flow excluding decommissioning expenditures since Cardinal believes the timing of payment or incurrence of these items involves a high degree of discretion and variability. Expenditures on decommissioning obligations vary from period to period depending on the maturity of the Company’s operating areas and availability of adjusted funds flow and are viewed as part of the Company’s capital budgeting process.\n\nFree cash flow\n\nManagement utilizes free cash flow as a measure to assess Cardinal’s ability to generate cash, after taking into account the development capital expenditures, to increase returns to shareholders, repay debt, or for other corporate purposes. As shown below, free cash flow is calculated as adjusted funds flow less development capital expenditures.\n\nThe following table reconciles cash flow from operating activities, funds flow, adjusted funds flow, and free cash flow:\n\nThree months ended Six months ended June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Cash flow from operating activities 71,463 61,220 110,827 102,309 Change in non-cash working capital 8,904 (9,102 ) 18,041 (2,640 ) Funds flow 80,367 52,118 128,868 99,669 Decommissioning expenditures 1,460 4,072 5,765 8,831 Adjusted funds flow 81,827 56,190 134,633 108,500 Total development capital expenditures (18,759 ) (29,867 ) (51,133 ) (53,354 ) Free cash flow 63,068 26,323 83,500 55,146\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Ratios\n\nNetback per boe\n\nCardinal utilizes operating netback per boe to assess the Company’s operating performance of its petroleum and natural gas assets on a per unit of production basis. Netback per boe is calculated as netback divided by total production for the applicable period. The following table details the calculation of netback per boe:\n\nThree months ended Six months ended June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Petroleum and natural gas revenue 83.17 71.56 77.20 70.28 Royalties (15.33 ) (13.35 ) (14.21 ) (13.26 ) Net operating expenses (23.65 ) (24.63 ) (24.89 ) (25.02 ) Transportation expenses (1.15 ) (1.07 ) (1.13 ) (0.99 ) Netback per boe 43.04 32.51 36.97 31.01\n\nNet debt to adjusted funds flow ratio\n\nCardinal utilizes net debt to adjusted funds flow to measure the Company’s overall debt position and to measure the strength of the Company’s balance sheet. Cardinal monitors this ratio and uses this as a key measure in making decisions regarding financing, capital expenditures and shareholder returns. Net debt to adjusted funds flow is calculated as net debt divided by the adjusted funds flow for the trailing twelve month period.\n\nTotal payout ratio\n\nCardinal utilizes this ratio as key measure to assess the Company’s ability to fund financing activities, operating activities, and capital expenditures. Total payout ratio is calculated as the sum of dividends declared plus development capital expenditures divided by adjusted funds flow trailing twelve month period.\n\nNet operating expenses per boe\n\nCardinal utilizes net operating expenses per boe to assess Cardinal’s operating efficiency of its petroleum and natural gas assets on a per unit of production basis. Net operating expense per boe is calculated as net operating expenses divided by total production for the applicable period.\n\nAdjusted funds flow per boe\n\nCardinal utilizes adjusted funds flow per boe as a measure to assess the ability of the Company to generate the funds necessary for financing activities, operating activities, capital expenditures and shareholder returns on a per boe basis. Adjusted funds flow per boe is calculated using adjusted funds flow divided by total production for the applicable period.\n\nAdjusted funds flow per basic share\n\nCardinal utilizes adjusted funds flow per share as a measure to assess the ability of the Company to generate the funds necessary for financing activities, operating activities, capital expenditures and shareholder returns on a per basic share basis. Adjusted funds flow per basic share is calculated using adjusted funds flow divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding.\n\nAdjusted funds flow per diluted share\n\nCardinal utilizes adjusted funds flow per share as a measure to assess the ability of the Company to generate the funds necessary for financing activities, operating activities, capital expenditures and shareholder returns on a per diluted share basis. Adjusted funds flow per diluted share is calculated using adjusted funds flow divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\n\nSupplementary Financial Measures\n\nNI 52-112 defines a supplementary financial measure as a financial measure that: (i) is, or is intended to be, disclosed on a periodic basis to depict the historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flow of an entity; (ii) is not disclosed in the financial statements of the entity; (iii) is not a non-GAAP financial measure; and (iv) is not a non-GAAP ratio. The supplementary financial measures used in this news release are either a per unit disclosure of a corresponding GAAP measure, or a component of a corresponding GAAP measure, presented in the financial statements. Supplementary financial measures that are disclosed on a per unit basis are calculated by dividing the aggregate GAAP measure (or component thereof) by the applicable unit for the period. Supplementary financial measures that are disclosed on a component basis of a corresponding GAAP measure are a granular representation of a financial statement line item and are determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOil and Gas Metrics\n\nThe term “boe” or barrels of oil equivalent may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Additionally, given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil, as compared to natural gas, is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1; utilizing a conversion ratio of 6:1 may be misleading as an indication of value.\n\nThe term “Payout” means the revenue from production from a well required to fully pay for the drilling, completion, equipping and tie-in of such well.\n\nInitial Production\n\nAny references in this news release to initial production rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however, such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will continue production and decline thereafter. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for Cardinal.\n\nMarket, Independent Third Party and Industry Data\n\nCardinal may use certain market, independent third party and industry data in respect of comparisons of Cardinal to certain peer entities, including as it relates to its decline rates, which data is based upon information from public sources, including as reported by such entities and other government or other independent industry publications and reports or based on estimates derived from such publications and reports. Cardinal has not conducted its own independent verification of such information. While Cardinal believes this data to be reliable, third party, market and industry data is subject to variations and cannot be verified with complete certainty due to limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey. Cardinal had not independently verified any of the data from independent third party sources or ascertained the underlying assumptions relied upon by such sources.\n\nAbout Cardinal Energy Ltd.\n\nCardinal is a Canadian oil and natural gas company with operations focused on low decline oil in Western Canada. Cardinal differentiates itself from its peers by having the lowest decline conventional asset base in Western Canada. Cardinal has recently announced the commencement of its first thermal SAGD oil development project which will further increase the long-term sustainability of the Company.\n\nFor further information:\n\nM.

                "text": "The regulatory landscape for ESG disclosure by U.S. public companies faces potentially dramatic changes, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) proposing rules that would mandate comprehensive climate change disclosures and integrate key aspects of sustainability reporting with annual reports. Against this backdrop, White & Case surveyed the SEC filings of 50 companies in the Fortune 100 to assess the latest trends in ESG disclosure.\n\nSurvey of ESG Disclosure—2020 to 2022\n\nFor its fourth annual survey of ESG disclosure in SEC filings, the White & Case Public Company Advisory Group reviewed the annual meeting proxy statements and annual reports of 50 companies in the Fortune 100. In these 100 SEC filings, we focused on 12 categories of ESG disclosure in annual reports and proxy statements filed with the SEC in 2020, 2021 and 2022. The key trends and takeaways from our survey are discussed below.\n\nClimate-Related Disclosure Takes the Spotlight in 2022\n\nIn the fall of 2021, ahead of Form 10-K filings, the SEC issued a sample comment letter on climate disclosure and also issued bespoke comment letters to a number of companies questioning their materiality assessments with respect to climate disclosure. Climate-related disclosure significantly increased in both Form 10-K and proxy statement filings of the surveyed companies, with many companies including such disclosure for the first time in 2022. Our survey focused on the ways climate disclosure changed year-over-year among the surveyed companies.\n\nThe Seven ESG Topics on the Rise in 2022\n\n1. Environmental Matters\n\nOverall for 2022, the largest increase in categories of ESG disclosure was with respect to environmental matters (up from third on the list in 2021) which covered a range of environmental topics, including investments in sustainability, recycling and renewable energy use. As shown in the chart below, 89 of the 2022 filings surveyed increased their environmental disclosure, compared to 35 of the 2021 filings and 29 of the 2020 filings.\n\nMoreover, every company surveyed (all 50 companies) included environmental disclosure in their 2022 filings. Of the 96 filings that included environmental disclosure in 2022:\n\nForty-eight companies (or 96%) included it in their Form 10-K (up from 37 in 2021 and 32 in 2020) and 48 companies (or 96%) in their proxy statement (the same number as in 2021 and up from 45 in 2020).\n\nThirty-seven filings (or 37%) included historical quantitative metrics (13 Form 10-Ks and 24 proxy statements), such as information on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions reductions and renewable energy use.\n\nAlthough the number of proxy statements that contained environmental disclosure has remained fairly constant, environmental disclosures in Form 10-Ks have increased significantly over the past two years. The fact that every company surveyed included environmental disclosures either in their Form 10-K or in their proxy statement, and that so many companies that already had robust environmental disclosure increased that disclosure in 2022, illustrates the significant focus on environmental issues in 2022.\n\nExamples of new environmental disclosures included the following:\n\nInvestments in Environmental Sustainability, for example: “Operate Sustainably. We have a long-standing and substantial commitment to sustainable business operations, from the products and services we offer to our customers; to our store construction, maintenance and operations; to our supply chain and packaging initiatives; to our ethical sourcing program. As we strive to operate sustainably, we have focused on protecting the climate, reducing our environmental impact, and sourcing responsibly, and we have set specific, measurable goals to drive progress in these areas.” Renewable Energy, for example: “The Climate Pledge is [the Company’s] commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040, and we are on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. As the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, [the Company] announced dozens of new renewable energy projects in 2021 and now has 274 projects globally. The Climate Pledge has been signed by [the Company] and over 300 other companies that commit to the same goals…Pledge signatories in total generate over $3.5 trillion in global annual revenues and have more than 8 million employees across 51 industries in 29 countries.” Climate Change Evaluation, for example: “As part of our commitment to being good stewards of the environment, we are working to understand, quantify, and reduce our impact on climate change. We understand that climate change poses risk and presents opportunities for our business to address such impacts in several ways. We recently undertook several actions to raise understanding about climate change and potential risks to our business, including…[e]valuating potential enterprise risks associated with climate change [and] [d]isclosing our baseline scope 1 and scope 2 [GHG] emissions, which we assessed in 2021 for calendar years 2019 and 2020. We are currently focused on calculating our scope 3 GHG emissions, and in conjunction with our Value Creation Plan, we are assessing energy usage and reduction opportunities and determining decarbonization goals.”\n\nSpotlight on Climate-Related Disclosure\n\nOverall, 43 of the surveyed companies (or 86%) increased their climate-related disclosure in their 2022 Form 10-Ks, and 35 companies (or 70%) increased this disclosure in their 2022 proxy statements. Seven companies (or 14%) addressed climate-related disclosure in their Form 10-K for the first time in 2022, and six companies (or 12%) addressed climate-related disclosure in their proxy statements for the first time in 2022.\n\nFour of the surveyed companies received comments from the SEC in 2021 on climate-related disclosure. Two of the four companies agreed to additional risk factor and/or Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) disclosure. Many other surveyed companies included additional Form 10-K disclosure that appeared, based on content, to be directly influenced by the SEC’s sample comment letter.\n\nFifteen companies added entirely new risk factors devoted to climate-related impacts (including physical impacts of climate change, transition risks to a low-carbon economy, compliance costs related to new and disparate regulations, and reputational risks), and 14 companies increased references to climate-related impacts in their existing risk factors.\n\nFor the surveyed companies, references to climate-related impacts increased by seven mentions on average and five companies added new sections discussing ESG, sustainability and climate change in their MD&A. Only two companies did not mention climate-related impacts in their 2022 Form 10-Ks and seven did not do so in their 2022 proxy statements.\n\n\n\nThe increase in climate-related risk factors is particularly notable. For example:\n\n“Climate Change Could Have a Negative Impact on [the Company’s] Results of Operations and Financial Condition.… Climate change presents both immediate and long-term risks to [the Company] and [our] customers and clients, with the risks expected to increase over time. Climate risks can arise from both physical risks (those risks related to the physical effects of climate change) and transition risks (risks related to regulatory and legal technological, market and reputational changes from a transition to a low-carbon economy)…”\n\n2. Human Capital Management (HCM)\n\nIn 2022, the second largest increase in ESG disclosures came in human capital management (“HCM”), down from first place in the prior three years.\n\nAs expected due to the SEC rule changes mandating human capital disclosure in the Form 10-K, every company surveyed included some form of HCM disclosure in their Form 10-K, and nearly all surveyed companies (96%) also included HCM disclosure in their annual meeting proxy statement. Eighty-six of the 2022 filings surveyed presented an increase in this type of disclosure from 2021 (up from 60 in 2021 and 35 in 2020), with 41 of these increases coming in the 10-K and 45 of these increases in the proxy statement. Increased disclosure included topics such as employee health and safety, talent management and development, employee engagement and pay equity.\n\nWithin HCM disclosures, we also found a significant number of quantitative disclosures in both 2021 and 2022. In 2022, of the 98 filings that included disclosure on HCM, 54 included current or historical quantitative metrics. These metrics included information on: (1) the percentage of employees who are women or people of color; (2) information on corporate initiatives to improve gender and ethnic diversity in their workforce; and (3) information on employee turnover and retention rates.\n\nThe below graphics represent the disclosure increases and the excerpts provide representative examples of the additional HCM disclosure:\n\nExamples of new disclosures included the following:\n\nOn Employee Engagement, for example: Associate engagement is the emotional commitment associates have to [the Company]. It is vital to our culture and to our success. We create an engaging workplace by continuously listening to and acting on associate feedback. We provide several pulse check surveys…that help us determine how emotionally connected those associates are to our customers, the Company, their jobs, fellow associates, and leaders. In addition, our annual Voice of the Associate survey…serves as our primary means of gauging associates’ level of engagement within their roles. We use the feedback from these surveys to help improve the overall associate experience …We also maintain a digital associate engagement platform that links associates with common interests and fuels connections to co-workers and Company leaders.” On Talent Retention, for example: “In 2021…our Employee Engagement Index, an overall measure of employee satisfaction with the Corporation, was 88%. Our turnover among employees was 12% in 2021 and 7% in 2020. Our pre-pandemic levels of turnover in 2019 and 2018 were 11% and 12%. Additionally, [we] provide[] a variety of resources to help employees grow in their current roles and build new skills, including resources to help employees find new opportunities, re-skill and seek leadership positions…In 2021, more than 26,000 employees found new roles within the Corporation.” On Pay Equity, for example: Since 2019, we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US. We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at grade level, and tenure.” On Employee Wellness and Flexible Working, for example: “Our offices and sites once again closed Company wide for one day in May 2021 to allow colleagues to recharge In 2021, in recognition of the new way of working, we initiated [ Flex, a hybrid model that empowers our office based employees to find the right productivity and balance of in person and remote work.”\n\nFocus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”)\n\nIn 2022, all but one of the companies surveyed (49 out of 50) included disclosure on diversity or related initiatives at the company, up from 43 in 2021 and 29 in 2020.\n\nIn 2022, most companies surveyed (44 out of 50) included this in both their Form 10-K and their proxy statement, although the disclosures in the proxy statements were generally more robust and detailed.\n\nOn Employee Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, for example: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): Building a world where progress, equitable outcomes, diversity, and inclusion can be realities is at the heart of what we do—from how we build our products to how we build our workforce. We have deepened our efforts to drive meaningful change but we know there is more to be done. We have a responsibility to continue scaling our DEI initiatives, to ensure a workforce that is more representative of our users, a workplace that creates a sense of belonging for everyone, and to increase pathways to tech in the communities we call home…In 2020, we implemented a series of industry-leading principles and improvements that incorporated input from both employees and stockholders, including the creation of a new DEI Advisory Council, which comprises internal senior executives and external DEI experts. We have also heightened our focus on promoting racial equity, including announcing in 2020 a series of racial equity commitments. We shared an update on our progress in 2021 and continue working to translate those efforts into lasting, meaningful change.”\n\nEEO-1 Data References. In 2022, 36 companies (or 72%) included EEO-1 data or referenced the provision of such data in a separate report, up from 16 (or 32%) in 2021. Thirty-two companies made this disclosure only in their proxy statement, two only in their Form 10-K and six included the disclosure in both filings. The prevalence of this disclosure was largely the result of renewed investor pressure and focus on these disclosures. For example, BlackRock called on companies to disclose their EEO-1 survey responses and, starting in 2022, State Street adopted a policy to vote “against” the compensation committee chairs at companies that do not disclose their EEO-1 survey responses.\n\nRepresentative examples of these disclosures include the following:\n\n“We released our 2021 [DEI] Report, in which we provide workforce diversity data, (including our EEO-1 data) and explain how we are working to drive progress through our pillars of action: public policy, workforce diversity, community engagement and supplier diversity.” “As part of our Health for Humanity Report publication in June 2021, we publicly disclosed our U.S. Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1, and we annually publish the You Belong: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Impact Review (DEI Impact Review), which examines how the Company’s global DEI strategy has been a key driver of innovation and business outcomes since our founding over 130 years ago.”\n\n3. E&S Goals and Targets\n\nFor the first time in White & Case’s annual survey, E&S Goals and Targets made the top seven categories, rising to the third spot with the largest increase in disclosure. This reflects the heightened focus by investors on companies setting specific targets with respect to environmental and social priorities.\n\nSeventy-six of the filings surveyed (or 76%) increased their disclosure related to E&S goals and targets. In total, all but one of the surveyed companies (49 out of 50) included some form of E&S goal or target. Of these, 32 companies included the disclosure in their Form 10-K and 48 companies included it in their proxy statement. Of the 49 companies that included E&S goals and targets, seven companies included them for the first time in their 2022 disclosures.\n\nE&S goals and targets cover a range of topics including long term goals to reach net zero, and shorter term goals to reduce GHG emissions by specified amounts.\n\nQuantitative E&S Goals and Targets. Notably, in addition to including qualitative goals and targets, a significant number of companies included quantitative metrics in their E&S goals and targets. Forty-four companies (or 88%) included some form of quantitative metric in their E&S goals and targets disclosure—18 in their Form 10-K (up from 11 in 2021) and 42 in their proxy (up from 26 in 2021). This demonstrates a growing trend of companies that are disclosing quantifiable goals in their SEC filings, and not just in sustainability reports or website disclosures, which can be measured and tracked by investors.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nGHG Emissions: Forty of the surveyed companies disclosed at least one specific goal relating to GHG emissions reduction on a given timeline. Twenty-three companies disclosed a specific net zero goal, ten companies disclosed a carbon neutral goal, 18 companies disclosed other specific emission reduction goals, and one company disclosed a goal to be carbon negative. Several companies disclosed a combination of emissions goals.\n\nFinancial Commitment Towards ESG: Seventeen of the surveyed companies set forward-looking quantitative goals to commit a specified amount of funds over a specific timeline towards ESG initiatives, such as diversity funds, sustainable energy, climate action and local community support.\n\nCommunity Investment: Thirteen of the surveyed companies set goals to support local communities through a specific number of volunteer hours committed, meals donated or people educated.\n\nRenewable Energy: Nine of the surveyed companies set a quantitative goal to meet their energy needs with 100% renewable energy by a given timeline and four companies set a goal to source a specific percentage or amount of renewable energy by a given timeline. Four companies set other quantitative renewable energy or energy conservation goals, such as achieving green certification for a certain percentage of their buildings or producing a certain amount of clean energy.\n\nExamples of new disclosures included the following:\n\nGHG Reductions Goals, for example: “The Company’s environmental goals, collectively called “Strive 35”—an ambitious plan to, by 2035, reduce from a 2019 baseline absolute Scope 1 and 2 [GHG] emissions by 25 percent, reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions by 25 percent, reduce energy intensity by 15 percent, reduce water intensity by 10 percent, and achieve a 90 percent landfill diversion rate—are part of an aggressive plan to continue to reduce the [our] environmental footprint…In 2021, [we] added 5-year interim targets to ensure the Company stays on track to meet its 2035 goals. By 2025, the Company aims to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 1.5%, reduce energy intensity and water intensity by 6% and 5%, respectively, and achieve 87% of its waste diverted from landfill.” Carbon Negative Goals, for example: “In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975.” Financial Commitments, for example: “In April 2021, we committed $1 trillion to sustainable finance by 2030, which builds on the work we outlined in our updated Sustainable Progress Strategy. This commitment includes extending our prior five-year, $250 billion environmental finance goal to $500 billion by 2030 through which we will finance and facilitate an array of climate solutions such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation and circular economy and $500 billion in social finance including affordable housing, diversity and equity, economic inclusion, food security and healthcare.” Employee Diversity Goals, for example: “We set the following goals to change our workforce representation by 2030: (i) globally, increase representation of women at the manager level and above to 48% (up from 40%); (ii) in the United States, increase representation of African American and Black employees at the manager level and above to 11% (up from 5%); and (iii) in the United States, increase representation of all other ethnically diverse groups at the manager level and above to 23% (up from 17%). To achieve these goals, we will focus on attracting, developing, and retaining diverse talent, from entry-level to senior leadership positions.”\n\n4. Corporate Culture\n\nSixty-one of the 2022 filings surveyed increased their disclosure on corporate culture, compared to 33 of the 2021 filings surveyed and 28 of the 2020 filings surveyed.\n\nOverall, 47 of the companies surveyed included disclosure on corporate culture in their 2022 filings, compared to 44 companies in 2021 and 43 companies in 2020.\n\nExamples of new disclosures included the following:\n\nCore Values, for example: “The [Company] has a strong commitment to ethics and integrity, and we are a values- and culture-centric business. Our commitment to our core values drives our approach to human capital management. Our culture is based on our servant leadership philosophy represented by the inverted pyramid, which puts primary importance on our customers and our associates by positioning them at the top, with senior management at the base in a support role. We bring our culture to life through our core values, which serve as the foundation of our business and the guiding principles behind the decisions we make every day.” Importance of Board in Shaping Culture, for example: “Our Board and its committees play a key role in establishing and maintaining our culture, setting the “tone at the top” and holding management accountable for its maintenance of high ethical standards and effective policies and practices to protect our reputation, assets, and business.”\n\n5. Board Oversight of Environmental and Social Issues\n\nFifty-six of the filings surveyed increased their disclosure related to board oversight of E&S issues in 2022, compared to 27 filings in 2021 and 22 filings in 2020. Overall, 47 companies included disclosure on board oversight of E&S issues in their 2022 filings.\n\nNotably, there has been an increasing trend of companies including this disclosure in their Form 10-Ks as well as their proxy statements. In 2022, 16 companies included this disclosure in their Form 10-Ks, up from eight in 2021 and one in 2020. Board oversight disclosures generally appeared in the business section of the surveyed companies’ Form 10-Ks.\n\nExamples of new disclosures include the following:\n\nESG Committee or Function Reporting to the Board, for example: “Our sustainability efforts are overseen by our Board of Directors, in particular a dedicated Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee, and led by our Chief Sustainability Officer… The Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee actively oversees our objectives, goals, strategies, and activities relating to sustainability and corporate responsibility matters and assists the Board in ensuring that we operate as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen in order to enhance shareholder value and protect [our] reputation.” Governance Committee Oversight of E&S, for example: “The [NGC] is responsible for overseeing management of risks related to our environmental, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility practices, including risks related to our operations and our supply chain.” Board Oversight of HCM, in Form 10-K business section, for example: “As we execute on the Company’s strategy in the coming years, our focus on organizational performance and talent will remain front and center. We will continue to monitor various factors across our human capital priorities, including as a part of our business operating reviews during the year and with oversight by our Board of Directors and the Board’s Management Development and Compensation Committee.” Specialized Board Committee Oversight of E&S Issues, in Form 10-K business section, for example: “Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide important oversight on certain human capital matters, including items discussed at the Executive People Forum. The Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee maintains responsibility to review, discuss, and set strategic direction for various people-related business strategies, including: compensation and benefit programs; leadership succession planning; culture; [DEI]; and talent development programs. The Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee is responsible for discussing and advising management on maintaining and improving sustainability strategies, the implementation of which creates value consistent with the long-term preservation and enhancement of shareholder value and social wellbeing, including human rights, working conditions, and responsible sourcing.”\n\nCommittee(s) with Oversight over ESG Matters.\n\nOf the 50 surveyed companies:\n\nThirty companies (or 60%) disclosed that their Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (“NGC”) oversaw some or all ESG Matters, up from 12 in 2021 (a 150% increase). Of these 30 companies: three disclosed that ESG matters were solely or primarily overseen by the NGC, while the other 27 companies disclosed that both the NCG and another committee had oversight over ESG matters.\n\nTwenty-seven companies disclosed that their Compensation Committee (“CC”) oversaw some or all ESG Matters; of these 27 companies, three disclosed that ESG matters were solely or primarily overseen by the CC, while the other 24 companies disclosed that there was shared ESG oversight between both the CC and another committee.\n\nTwenty-three companies disclosed that at least some ESG matters were overseen by a more specialized committee or committees, such as a dedicated Sustainability Committee or a Public Responsibility Committee.\n\nFourteen companies disclosed that the audit committee had oversight over some ESG issues, such as risks and exposures associated with civil and human rights and sustainability, identifying ESG investment criteria and providing assurance of ESG disclosures. Additionally, ten companies disclosed that the full board shared E&S oversight responsibilities with another committee.\n\nIt is interesting to note that 34 companies disclosed that they allocated responsibility for oversight of ESG issues to more than one committee (up from 21 in 2021), with six companies disclosing that they allocate responsibility to four committees and five companies disclosing allocation of ESG oversight to five committees. This increase in allocation of ESG oversight to more than one committee reflects the increasing role boards have in providing oversight of ESG issues and allows committees to narrow and deepen their focus on different facets of these issues. For example, many companies disclosed that ESG issues were divided between committees that focused on human capital and social/public policy issues and those that focused on environmental and sustainability issues.\n\n6. Social Impact and Community\n\nThe social impact and community category of ESG disclosure moved down from second to sixth on our list of increased ESG disclosure. Specifically, 55 of the 2022 filings surveyed (or 55%), including 16 Form 10-Ks, increased their disclosure related to social impact and community relations, compared to 40 in 2021 (or 40%) and 21 in 2020 (or 21%).\n\nExamples of new disclosures included the following:\n\nCommunity Development and Engagement, for example: “We are committed to creating value for our communities through economic development, philanthropy, volunteerism and advocacy, and by operating our business in a socially and environmentally responsible way. The communities in which our assets are located and where our employees live are critical stakeholders. We consistently and regularly engage with our local communities and seek their feedback. Our refining operations have community advisory councils or panels that include both Company representatives and community members…Our pipeline business units have year-round community awareness, education and listening panels to stay connected with those involved with and living near our extensive pipeline network.” Access to Technology, for example: “Access to affordable and reliable internet service is critical for work, learning and commerce—and for staying digitally connected to family, friends, news and information. Using our platform to address the digital divide is strategically important to [the Company], as it helps drive social change while expanding our network reach and deepening valuable collaboration with communities, authorities and NGOs…In 2021, [the Company] announced a commitment to invest $2 billion over the next 3 years to help address the digital divide…As part of our $2 billion digital divide commitment, we introduced [] Connected Learning, a multi-year initiative led by our CSR organization to help stem the tide of learning loss, further narrow the homework gap and empower today’s learners…Through the end of 2022, we’re launching more than 20 [] Connected Learning Centers in under-resourced neighborhoods facing barriers to connectivity—providing access to high-speed internet and computing devices, as well as opportunities for tutoring and mentorship through our employee-driven [Company] volunteerism initiative.”\n\n7. E&S Issues in Shareholder Engagements\n\nForty companies increased their disclosure related to ESG issues included in their shareholder engagements in their 2022 proxy statements, up from 21 in both 2021 and 2020. Overall, 48 companies disclosed that ESG issues were included in their shareholder engagements in their 2022 proxy statements, up from 45 in 2021 and 40 in 2020.\n\nExamples of new disclosures included the following:\n\nResponsiveness to Shareholder Feedback (in 21 of the 45 filings). For example: “Our Board believes that solicitation and consideration of shareholder feedback is critical to driving long-term growth and creating shareholder value. Our shareholder engagement program is a robust, year-round process encompassing meetings held throughout the year with shareholders during which we encourage ongoing, meaningful dialogue about the issues they find most important…Our Board reviews our annual meeting results, ongoing shareholder feedback and corporate governance and compensation trends to help drive and develop our shareholder engagement priorities…We respond to shareholder feedback by enhancing our policies, practices and disclosures informed by ongoing dialogue with our shareholders and communicate important updates and enhancements made during the fiscal year in our proxy statement.” Mention of Specific E&S Issues Discussed, for example: “Recent Board discussions have addressed shareholder feedback on a variety of topics, including Board refreshment, shareholder proposals, executive compensation, sustainability and human capital management and political advocacy, often resulting in changes to our policies and practices as well as guiding the focus of future discussions in the boardroom…We also fulfilled our commitment to publish our first Sustainability Report and publicly disclosed our workplace diversity data, including our consolidated EEO-1 report. Recognizing the continued importance of transparency on political advocacy, we strengthened our website disclosures to provide additional detail regarding the Board and Governance & Public Policy Committee’s enhanced oversight role, information on our direct lobbying activities, and our political contributions guidelines and political action committee processes and oversight.”\n\nReporting Frameworks: SASB, TCFD and Others\n\nThe 2022 SEC filings revealed a continuing trend of more companies disclosing the use of reporting frameworks. In 2022, 38 of the surveyed companies disclosed in their SEC filings that their sustainability reports posted on their website follow or align with specific reporting frameworks, a significant increase from 26 in 2021, 11 in 2020 and just one company in 2019.\n\nIn general, companies are trending towards disclosing the use of more than one framework. In 2022, five companies reported using only one framework, whereas 33 companies reported using at least two or more frameworks (compared to 16 companies using two or more frameworks in 2021). In 2022, of the 38 surveyed companies that disclosed their use of frameworks:\n\nTwenty-five surveyed companies disclosed that they align their sustainability reporting with both Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) standards and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) frameworks (compared to 13 in 2021).\n\nEight companies only referenced SASB standards or SASB plus another non-TCFD standard (compared to 5 in 2021) and four companies only referenced TCFD or TCFD plus another non-SASB standard (compared to eight in 2021).\n\nEighteen of the 38 companies in 2022 disclosed that they aligned with Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) standards (compared to six in 2021), with one company exclusively using the GRI standards.\n\nCompanies also disclosed that they use other reporting frameworks such as CDP (formerly known as The Climate Disclosure Project) (five companies), the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (two companies), the UN Sustainable Development Goals (three companies) and the UN Global Compact (one company).\n\nCompanies continue to make these disclosures referencing the reporting frameworks that they use primarily in their proxy statements. In 2022, only one company disclosed its reporting frameworks solely in its Form 10-K, whereas six companies made this disclosure in both their Form 10-K and proxy statements, and 31 companies made this disclosure exclusively in their proxy statement.\n\nThe significant increase in disclosure regarding use of these reporting frameworks echoes the calls from the investor community, including BlackRock, which has asked the public companies it invests in to (i) “disclose the identification, assessment, management, and oversight of sustainability-related risks in accordance with the four pillars of TCFD,” and (ii) “publish investor-relevant, industry-specific, material metrics and rigorous targets, aligned with SASB or comparable sustainability reporting standards.”\n\nExamples of new disclosures included the following:\n\nDisclosed following TCFD, for example: “In our most recent Task Force for Climate Change-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)-aligned report issued in October 2021, we described our GHG intensity targets for oil, gas, flaring, and methane for 2028.” Disclosed following more than one standard, for example: “[The Company] participates in the CDP’s climate, forestry and water security questionnaires to benchmark and quantify our environmental practices, to provide transparency on our progress and assist in the reduction of our contributions to climate change. We continue to align our sustainability reporting with the appropriate [SASB] standards for our industry, the [GRI] and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”). We also published our first [TCFD] report in 2021 to assess our climate-related risks and opportunities and better understand the potential impacts on our value chain.” Disclosed following more than one standard, for example: “We are committed to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk and use the framework developed by the TCFD to inform our disclosure on climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets…Our Corporate Responsibility Report also includes a mapping of our disclosure to the TCFD, the [SASB] framework, and our CDP Climate Change Survey, all of which are available on our website.”\n\nThree Key Take-Aways\n\nGiven these disclosure trends and influences, when contemplating any ESG disclosure in connection with SEC filings, public reporting companies should consider the following key takeaways:\n\n1. ESG: What’s In and What’s Out of SEC Filings\n\nBased on our survey, the top ESG topics for 2022 SEC filings were:\n\nEnvironmental disclosure, with a focus on climate change, which moved up from third to first in 2022;\n\nHuman capital management, with a focus on diversity and inclusion; and\n\nE&S targets and goals, which made the top seven list for the first time since our survey began in 2019.\n\nThese top categories for increase reflect the key areas of corporate, SEC and investor focus this year for the surveyed companies.\n\n2. A Renewed Focus on ESG for Form 10-Ks\n\nEven ahead of the SEC’s adoption of any new climate rules, in-house teams should take note of the growing trend of providing ESG disclosure in annual reports on Form 10-Ks. The results of our survey demonstrate a re-focus and movement towards the Form 10-K for enhanced ESG disclosures. For example, 15 of the surveyed companies added entirely new risk factors devoted to climate change impacts, and more broadly, environmental disclosures in Form 10-Ks have increased significantly over the past two years while remaining fairly constant in proxy statements.\n\nThis increase in Form 10-K disclosure, particularly on the environment, came on the heels of the September 2021 sample letter on climate disclosure. As a result of this growing trend, companies should zero in on their (1) materiality assessments for climate change, (2) their approach towards differentiating their Form 10-K from sustainability reports, and (3) enhancing their controls on ESG disclosure. More specifically:\n\nConfirm Your Materiality Assessments . In terms of the materiality assessments, companies should continue to consider the SEC’s 2010 climate change disclosure guidance12 and the recent comment letters from Corp Fin on companies’ climate disclosure. SEC comments to date on climate disclosure initially asked questions focusing on a company’s materiality analysis and then requested additional details on the company’s determination that disclosure of climate change matters was not necessary because the climate change matters were not material. In some cases, the follow-up comments requested that companies provide quantitative information to support their materiality determinations.\n\n.

In some cases, the follow-up comments requested that companies provide quantitative information to support their materiality determinations. Differentiate ESG for Your Form 10-K and Sustainability Report . With respect to sustainability reporting, it is important to note the growing SEC scrutiny of the divide between the content of SEC filings and sustainability reports. One of the SEC sample comments asked companies to advise the SEC of “what consideration” a company “gave to providing the same type of climate-related disclosure in your SEC filings as you provided in your CSR report.” Although companies have largely continued to provide the vast majority of their ESG disclosure on corporate websites in sustainability reports, as opposed to their Form 10-Ks, the rationale for this divide is being called into question by both the SEC comments and proposed rule changes on climate.\n\n. With respect to sustainability reporting, it is important to note the growing SEC scrutiny of the divide between the content of SEC filings and sustainability reports. One of the SEC sample comments asked companies to advise the SEC of “what consideration” a company “gave to providing the same type of climate-related disclosure in your SEC filings as you provided in your CSR report.” Although companies have largely continued to provide the vast majority of their ESG disclosure on corporate websites in sustainability reports, as opposed to their Form 10-Ks, the rationale for this divide is being called into question by both the SEC comments and proposed rule changes on climate. Enhance Your Controls on ESG. Following from these two points, it is crucial to confirm whether (a) any ESG disclosures (whether they be on website sustainability reports, or communicated to investors, underwriters or banks) may be material and therefore required to be included in a Form 10-K, and (b) sufficient controls are in place to ensure their accuracy and enable the information to be covered by Sarbanes Oxley certifications signed by CEOs and CFOs and filed with the SEC.\n\n3. Focus on Next Steps in Light of ESG Trends and Proposed SEC Disclosure Rules on Climate\n\nAs the deadline passes for comments on the SEC’s rule proposal on climate change disclosure, the SEC will determine the fate of ESG disclosures in SEC filings, particularly the Form 10-K. In the meantime, companies will need to:\n\nFirst, prepare to update your company’s ESG disclosure on a holistic basis for future reports—across your sustainability report, proxy statement and your Form 10-K—as if the new SEC rules will not yet be in effect next year. Companies should begin considering their ESG disclosure on particular topics (for example, human capital and climate) on a holistic basis across all of their disclosure documents to ensure consistency, appropriate vetting of the accuracy of the disclosures and consistent messaging to investors. Second, carefully scrutinize any proposed expansion of your ESG disclosures at this time and make sure they undergo a comprehensive legal review. It is crucial that companies take a hard look at any new proposed ESG disclosures at this time and conduct a thorough legal assessment of the implications of making any such new disclosures. In particular, a company should consider in detail how the proposed rules (if adopted as proposed) would impact any such new disclosure, particularly as it relates to new E&S targets or goals and transition plans. Third, take steps to prepare for the proposed SEC climate rules now as if they will be adopted substantially as proposed. Companies should establish a working group (including legal, financial reporting, sustainability, IR and communications) and begin their assessment of what steps would need to be taken in order to comply with the new climate change disclosure requirements if the proposed rules are adopted substantially as proposed. This includes creating a plan to tackle those elements of the proposed rules that will be the most challenging for companies to comply with and require the most lead time to implement. Last but not least….remember the key word here: Controls, controls and more effective controls. Regardless of whether companies include enhanced ESG disclosure in their next Form 10-Ks, in light of the enhanced SEC scrutiny and trends on the horizon, companies should treat this disclosure as if it were subject to their disclosure controls and procedures under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This means establishing the same rigor of controls for such disclosure, such as completing a sub-certification process and disclosure committee oversight to appropriately vet and confirm the accuracy of required disclosures.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1For more information, see our alert “SEC Proposes Long-Awaited Climate Change Disclosure Rules.”(go back)\n\n2The 2018-2019 White & Case LLP Survey is available here and the 2019-2020 White & Case LLP Survey is available here.(go back)\n\n3The companies in this survey consist of the following: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Anthem, Inc., Apple Inc., Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, AT&T Inc., Bank of America Corporation, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., The Boeing Company, Cardinal Health, Inc., Centene Corporation, Chevron Corporation, Citigroup Inc., Comcast Corporation, Costco Wholesale Corporation, CVS Health Corporation, Dell Technologies Inc., DuPont de Nemours, Inc., Exxon Mobil Corporation, FedEx Corporation, Ford Motor Company, General Electric Company, General Motors Company, The Home Depot, Inc., International Business Machines Corporation, Intel Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase & Co., The Kroger Co., Lowe’s Companies, Inc., Marathon Petroleum Corporation, McKesson Corporation, MetLife, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, PepsiCo, Inc., Phillips 66, The Procter & Gamble Company, Prudential Financial, Inc., Raytheon Technologies Corporation, Sysco Corporation, Target Corporation, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, United Parcel Service, Inc., Valero Energy Corporation, Verizon Communications Inc., Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Walmart Inc., The Walt Disney Company and Wells Fargo & Company.(go back)\n\n4The 12 categories of E&S disclosure in this survey are the following: (1) Board Oversight of E&S Issues; (2) Corporate Culture; (3) Ethical Business Practices; (4) Human Capital Management; (5) Environmental Matters; (6) Social Impact and Community; (7) Political Contribution Disclosure; (8) Supply Chain Management; ; (9) E&S Qualifications of Directors; (10) E&S Issues in Shareholder Engagement; (11) E&S Goals; and (12) References to Sustainability Reporting Frameworks, including SASB and/or TCFD.(go back)\n\n5For more information, see our alert “SEC Issues Sample Comment Letter as it Ramps up Scrutiny of Climate Disclosures.”(go back)\n\n6Public company ESG disclosures vary significantly for a variety of reasons, and the disclosure examples included in this article are representative of the subjects covered within each applicable category.

                "text": "CALGARY, AB, June 29, 2023 /CNW/ – Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd. (“Tamarack” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the release of its fourth annual Sustainability Report, highlighting the Company’s ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles and sustainable practices during 2022. The Company continues to look for opportunities to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Company and the Canadian energy sector.\n\nHighlights of Tamarack’s 2022 Sustainability Performance\n\nDelivered significant progress towards the Company’s clear, measurable goals and targets, including achievement of more than 50% of its ESG goals to date – on time or ahead of schedule;\n\nDemonstrated commitment to accountability and transparency through the issuance of two tranches of sustainability-linked notes, as well as independent third-party assurance of key ESG metrics;\n\nAchieved emissions and methane intensity reductions of 19% and 45%, respectively, compared to the 2020 baseline, exceeding the 2025 methane intensity reduction goal of 40% and progressing towards the 2025 emissions intensity reduction goal of 39%;\n\nIncreased investment in abandonment, remediation and reclamation activities through Tamarack funded expenditures equivalent to 8.8% of inactive liabilities or more than 200% of the voluntary regulatory program spend, exceeding our target of 150% of voluntary program spend for 2022, with additional funds equivalent to 3.7% of inactive liability deployed through grants and the site rehabilitation program; and\n\nFurthered diversity in the workforce, with increased ethnic (13.1%) and Indigenous (7.9%) representation in the Company’s contractor and employee base and an increase in gender diversity (28.6%) at the board level which was further increased (37.5%) subsequent to year-end 2022. Tamarack was recognized by the Globe and Mail during the Report on Business 2023 Women Lead Here program for the female representation in 2022 at the highest leadership levels in the organization.\n\nMessage to Stakeholders\n\nThe last two years brought significant changes for our organization, including the evolution of Tamarack’s asset base under the Company’s growth and portfolio rationalization strategy culminating in $1.7 billion in highly economic asset acquisitions in 2022. Tamarack has a proven track record of applying the same rigorous ESG standards to acquisitions that are applied to our legacy asset base. These newly acquired greenfield assets require significant financial and human resource investments to create a positive environmental and social footprint. With Tamarack’s experience and robust capitalization, the Company is in the strongest position to develop these assets in a long-term and sustainable manner.\n\nIn 2022, our emissions intensity increased over the prior year to 30.3 kg CO 2 e/boe due to sizable acquisitions and development in the Clearwater area. As part of these acquisitions, Tamarack committed to investing the capital required to improve the emissions intensity of these assets and has multiple ongoing gas conservation projects in the West Marten Hills, Nipisi and South Clearwater areas. Tamarack continues to work towards the ambitious goal of 22.9 kg CO 2 e/boe (39% reduction) by 2025.\n\nTamarack has established a successful model for emissions reductions in acquisitions, starting with the immediate conversion of vent to combustion followed by short-term optimization in the first 12 months of operations and then long-term, large-scale infrastructure projects spanning one to three years. An example of this can be seen through the 2020 Clearwater acquisitions and the subsequent Nipisi multi-phase gas infrastructure project with capital invested in excess of $20 million through 2021 and 2022. On acquisition, one of the core Nipisi assets had an emissions intensity of approximately 100 kg CO 2 e/boe. Through the conversion of vent volumes to flare and optimization of the operations, Tamarack was able to reduce the facility to less than 38 kg CO 2 e/boe within the first three months and down to less than 20 kg CO 2 e/boe within two years.\n\nTamarack’s 2023 Sustainability Report covers performance metrics for the 2020 to 2022 calendar years and aligns with guidance set forth by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) with consideration for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG).\n\nThe full Report can be accessed through the Company’s website at www.tamarackvalley.ca.\n\nOperations Update\n\nAlberta Wildfires & Third-Party Infrastructure Downtime\n\nAlthough the Company experienced negligible infrastructure damage, the Alberta wildfire situation had both direct and indirect impacts on Tamarack’s operations, including production impacts associated with unplanned third-party infrastructure downtime. These events drove a collective impact of approximately 1,500 boe/d for the second quarter. These issues have been resolved and are not expected to have an impact on the second half of 2023. Despite the production impact, the Company was able to maintain the safety of all workforce members and the integrity of our assets throughout these potentially catastrophic events. The safety of our people and the integrity of our assets is, and will continue to be, the priority in Tamarack’s operations. In addition, Tamarack provided financial support to Indigenous and local communities in the areas where we operate, for assistance with displacement and emergency response. We will continue to monitor for opportunities to assist in the rebuilding stages.\n\nCharlie Lake – Wembley Gas Plant\n\nCommissioning of the new Wembley gas plant was completed in June, ahead of schedule, with gas processing and sales commencing in mid-June. This 15 mmcf/d sweet gas facility now provides consistent and reliable processing capacity within Tamarack’s operational control and secures egress for Tamarack’s ongoing regional development. In addition to the facility’s current capacity, this plant is expandable and could support long-term growth in the Charlie Lake program.\n\nWe will provide a more fulsome operations update in conjunction with our second quarter results, which will be released before market on July 27, 2023.\n\nAbout Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd.\n\nTamarack is an oil and gas exploration and production company committed to balancing operational and financial excellence with environmental and social responsibility. By operating at the intersection of profitability and corporate responsibility, Tamarack creates long-term value for its shareholders through sustainable free funds flow generation, financial stability and the return of capital, while simultaneously ensuring we deliver on our environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments and goals. The Company has an extensive inventory of low-risk, oil development drilling locations focused primarily on Charlie Lake, Clearwater and EOR plays in Alberta.
