ðŸš€ Action Plan for ESG Score Processing Agent
Objective
Extract relevant data from Supabase tables (Companies, Financials, ESG Reports, Sentiment Data, Market Data, Governance Risk).
Preprocess & Structure the extracted data for the LLM.
Use an LLM prompt to compute Environmental (E), Social (S), Governance (G), and Overall ESG Scores.
Store final scores in final_esg_scores table.

ðŸ“Œ Implementation Steps
Step 1: Extract Data from Supabase
Use SQL queries to fetch relevant data from all tables for the given tickers.

Step 2: Preprocess & Structure Data
Convert JSONB fields into structured dictionaries.
Normalize text-heavy fields (like summaries) using NLP preprocessing.
Aggregate sentiment data (average sentiment score).
Merge financials & governance risk into company profiles.
Step 3: Send Structured Data to LLM
Construct a structured JSON input for the LLM using all data fields.
Use LangChain or OpenAI API for processing.
Step 4: Compute ESG Scores via LLM
Pass structured company data to LLM.
LLM will return weighted E, S, G scores + Final ESG Score.
Step 5: Store in final_esg_scores
Insert computed scores into Supabase.
