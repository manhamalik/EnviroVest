As a purpose-driven and brand-led CPG company, we operate with the Vision to be the most sustainable protein company on Earth. And we\u2019re not just saying that \u2014 we mean it!\n\nEarlier this year, we released our evolved Blueprint which acts as a strategic compass for the organization. The Blueprint outlines the Company\u2019s five core strategies in its pursuit of delivering value for its stakeholders:\n\nLead the Way : By making better food, taking better care, and nurturing a better planet.\n\n: By making better food, taking better care, and nurturing a better planet.

We use these pillars to track our progress towards achieving our Vision and the goals and milestones we set along the way.\n\nWe\u2019re proud of the progress we\u2019ve made and the impact we\u2019re having, and we\u2019re excited to share our journey with you. Read on for key insights from our 2023 Integrated Report to learn more about our sustainability efforts and how we\u2019re working towards a better future for all.\n\nMaking better food for Canadians\n\nDid you know that in 2023, we launched a new Maple Leaf Natural Selections\u00ae offering of deli meats?\n\nMade with only premium meat and real, simple, and natural ingredients, our Natural Selections\u00ae deli meats show our commitment to lead the real food movement. We\u2019re also making our packaging easier to read and understand, with claims on the front of the pack so that you know exactly what you\u2019re purchasing and feeding to your family.\n\nWe\u2019re thrilled to share that multiple products under our Family of Brands ranked #1 in Canada! These include:\n\nSchneiders for Packaged Meats\n\nMina Halal brand in fresh poultry\n\nGreenfield for Sustainable Packaged Meats\n\nMaple Leaf Prime for fresh poultry.\n\nAnd Maple Leaf is the #2 brand in Packaged Meats in Canada, and in the U.S. for Refrigerated Plant Protein, Maple Leaf Foods is #1 in Tempeh, #1 in Hot Dogs, and #1 in Bacon. Our consumers \u2014 people just like you \u2014 are an integral part of this accomplishment and we\u2019re delighted that you continue to love and purchase our delicious protein products.\n\nWorkplace safety for our people\n\nAt Maple Leaf Foods, we care for our people \u2014 a lot! This includes protecting their safety and well-being at work. In 2023, we completed social compliance audits at our five biggest facilities and advanced an improved social compliance program. We also announced that we would initiate an independent third-party human rights impact assessment that focuses on migrant workers that we employ \u2014 an incredibly important part of our team. We believe that progressing our social compliance programs, like doing social audits and human rights impact assessments, are essential parts of enhancing our social responsibility, compliance, and human rights within our organization.\n\nAlso in 2023, we reached a Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of 0.40* which is a 93.6% improvement from our 2012 baseline year. That means that 32 of our sites had zero recordable injuries*. This reflects our unwavering commitment to workplace safety, our Safety Promise, and our ongoing improvement in safety protocols. Last year, we had zero fatalities \u2014 a trend that has lasted for more than a decade.\n\nDid you know that in addition to our strategic Blueprint, we also follow a Diversity and Inclusion Blueprint? We are proud to continually evolve new, impactful goals to advance our diversity, support equity, and keep a steady focus on creating an inclusive culture within our organization \u2014 it\u2019s just the right thing to do!\n\nVolunteering to build stronger communities\n\nWe\u2019re committed to improving the well-being of communities, both inside and outside of our four walls. In 2016, we created the Maple Leaf Centre for Food Security (AKA \u201cthe Centre\u201d) and since then, it has donated more $12.4 million to 33 projects that aim to tackle the root causes of food insecurity across Canada. The Centre has also advocated for government policies and led awareness-raising campaigns to involve Canadians and drive systemic change.\n\nWe also host the Raise the Good in the Neighbourhood volunteer program, where our Team Members get two paid days off per year to volunteer at the cause of their choice. Our Team Members volunteered their time in more than 40 communities across the country in places like local food banks, healthcare institutions and hospitals, local community centres, newcomer services, and more. We\u2019re proud that our people are contributing to a better understanding of the issues and needs that groups are facing while building connections within their communities.\n\nFostering our animal care practices\n\nWe are deeply committed to reduce the use of antibiotics in our animals while ensuring animals get treatment when needed. In 2023, antibiotic use in the pigs we raise continued to decline. Since 2014, we\u2019ve reduced antibiotic usage by 99.3% across our own hog production operations.\n\nAs of the end of 2021, we\u2019ve reached our goal of converting all owned sow spaces (69,850 sow spaces) to our Advanced Open Sow Housing system \u2014 which now represents 93% of our sow spaces after acquiring more sow barns.\n\nJoining forces to nurture a better planet\n\nBack in 2015, we set a goal to lower our environmental impact by 50% by 2025 (2014 baseline) in five key areas:\n\nElectricity\n\nNatural gas\n\nWater\n\nSolid waste (2015 baseline)\n\nFood loss and waste (2016 baseline).\n\nWhile we have made some improvements in these areas, we acknowledge that the speed of improvement has been slowed by various factors, like the effect of the global pandemic which postponed some initiatives, and the timing of starting up our new facilities and the delay in closing down related older plants. We know that there are some difficulties in setting ambitious science-based goals and we are dedicated to providing clear updates on our progress towards these sustainability objectives!\n\nWe do what we can today to create a better future for tomorrow. That\u2019s why we\u2019re proud members of the Canadian Alliance for Net-Zero Agri-Food (CANZA), a national, industry-led, multi-stakeholder alliance that was created in 2023. Founded by The Natural Step Canada and the Smart Prosperity Institute, and in collaboration with the Arrell Food Institute at the University of Guelph, Maple Leaf Foods participates in CANZA alongside RBC, Nutrien, McCain Foods, Loblaw, and BCG.\n\nThe agri-food sector is a vital part of Canada\u2019s economy, but it also produces a lot of greenhouse gas. CANZA works to support sustainable solutions in this sector, by encouraging farmers to use regenerative agriculture and carbon farming practices. These practices can help the sector become circular and net-zero, meaning that it does not create more emissions than it can remove. The alliance works with farmers to help them improve their natural environment, and to create a more sustainable future for agriculture.\n\nJoin us on our sustainability journey and let\u2019s Raise the Good in Food together!

                "article_text": "New online challenge engages families with simple at-home activities that convey the importance of regenerative agriculture\n\nMISSISSAUGA, ON, Oct. 30, 2024 /CNW/ - Maple Leaf Foods Inc. (TSX: MFI), the world's first major carbon neutral food company, continues to support Canadians with climate-friendly little changes that can collectively contribute to a better planet. November 7 marks the third annual Little Changes Day, established to celebrate Maple Leaf Foods' carbon neutral anniversary and encourage Canadians to partake in their own sustainability journey, by integrating eco-friendly habits into everyday routines.\n\nA recent survey1 from Maple Leaf Foods reveals nearly all Canadians (94%) care about protecting the environment and 84% agree that working together is important to turn the tide of climate change, yet many don't know where to start to make a difference. Maple Leaf Foods started Little Changes Day to inspire Canadians with simple and fun resources to help jumpstart Canadians' eco-friendly habits. This year, the Little Changes Day 'Grow Your Own Greens' challenge was developed in partnership with Earth Rangers, the kids' conservation organization. Accessible via the Earth Rangers App, the challenge teaches families about the importance of sustainable farming practices, through simple, eco-friendly at-home activities, including how to:\n\nGrow your own greens using kitchen scraps (e.g. using lettuce stalks and herb stems)\n\nCreate indoor planters using recycled materials\n\nSuccessfully plant indoors, with information on the best types of planters, soil, and veggies that grow best inside (e.g. lettuce, microgreens, herbs)\n\n\"Prioritizing sustainable choices to protect the environment is something we're committed to as part of our broader mission to 'Raise the Good in Food',\" says Joe McMahan, Vice President, Sustainability and Shared Value at Maple Leaf Foods. \"Little Changes Day is just one way in which we encourage Canadians to participate in our purposeful journey to better protect our planet and food supply.\"\n\n\"This year's 'Grow Your Own Greens' challenge shows families how eco-friendly farming practices can make a difference. Through knowledge and understanding, Canadians can help us to maintain Canada's food supply for future generations. Change can start from something as small as growing lettuce in your kitchen, to the solutions we're delivering on a much larger scale, such as regenerative agriculture practices within our supply chain to support our growers,\" says McMahan.\n\nPositive momentum for the planet\n\nThe third Little Changes Day builds on the momentum of ongoing resources and activities designed to provide eco-friendly tips for families looking for easy ways to practice sustainability. From learning how to curb household carbon emissions through 2022's Little Changes Home Challenge or conserving electricity and connecting with family through 2023's Disconnect to Reconnect Challenge, year-over-year, each activity has shown how easy and FUN combatting climate change can be.\n\nA partnership that's making a difference\n\nAs long-term supporters of Earth Rangers' mission, Maple Leaf Foods has collaborated on multiple initiatives that have empowered more than 200,000 members to take action for the planet. The latest Little Changes Day challenge is just one activity to be included within the wider Future Farmer Mission that explores how regenerative agriculture helps to improve soil health, fight climate change, and increase biodiversity to ensure plants and animals thrive. It has, to date, seen more than 3,000 completed actions.\n\n\"Teaching younger generations about the importance of protecting the environment in a fun and relatable way that encourages positive action helps give kids a sense of agency and confidence in their ability to make a difference in the fight against climate change,\" says Tovah Barocas, President of Earth Rangers. \"With organizations like Maple Leaf Foods' support, the Future Farmer Mission and new Grow Your Own Greens Challenge are increasing agricultural knowledge and access to fresh food among kids and families, while making the connection between the food we eat and broader sustainability issues.\"\n\nHow to take part\n\nThe Future Farmer Mission is available now, and the Grow Your Own Greens Challenge launches on November 7. Both are accessible for free through the Earth Rangers App.\n\nTo learn more about Maple Leaf Foods' commitment to environmental sustainability, visit MapleLeafFoods.com/our-commitments.\n\nAbout Maple Leaf Foods\n\nMaple Leaf Foods is a carbon neutral company with a vision to be the most sustainable protein company on earth, responsibly producing food products under leading brands including Maple Leaf\u00ae, Maple Leaf Prime\u00ae, Maple Leaf Natural Selections\u00ae, Schneiders\u00ae, Schneiders\u00ae Country Naturals\u00ae, Mina\u00ae, Greenfield Natural Meat Co. \u00ae, LightLife\u00ae and Field Roast\u2122.

                "article_text": "The corporate world is experiencing a shift toward Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategies, driven by increasing awareness of climate change, societal expectations, and the necessity for sustainable business practices.\n\nThe push for ESG strategies is seen not just as a matter of compliance but as good business stewardship, addressing the urgent need to adapt to evolving environmental and social conditions.\n\nDespite this, ESG strategies often face scrutiny and criticism for being superficial or mere public relations exercises, known as greenwashing.\n\nAs Michael McCain, the Executive Chair of Maple Leaf Foods notes, it\u2019s important to problem-solve for both commercial success and societal challenges by integrating ESG practices into their everyday workflows. It\u2019s something he\u2019s focused on bringing to life at one of Canada\u2019s largest producer of food products, and one he recently shared some thoughts on with leaders at RBC.\n\nHere are some of his key thoughts and takeaways.\n\nAdopt a Problem-Solving Mindset\n\nOne of the most critical first steps in developing an ESG strategy that will resonate with stakeholders is to adopt a problem-solving mindset \u2013 one that involves identifying core issues within a business that intersect with its operations.\n\nFor instance, companies in the agricultural sector might focus on sustainable farming practices to reduce their environmental footprint. Those in the manufacturing industry might prioritize energy efficiency and waste reduction.\n\nBy clearly defining the problems they aim to solve, businesses can create targeted and effective strategies that lead to meaningful outcomes. This approach shifts the focus from mere compliance to addressing real-world issues that affect both the business and its stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about actual problem solving and finding a way to define the problem in your landscape,\u201d McCain explains. \u201c[Solving for something] that\u2019s a multi-stakeholder problem and then transitioning that solution into something that\u2019s good for the enterprise is where the business strategy [can come in].\u201d\n\nSet Clear Goals\n\nOnce a problem has been identified, the goal for businesses should be to set clear goals. McCain notes, for him, this is paramount for any successful ESG strategy.\n\nMcCain notes that at Maple Leaf Foods, leaders committed to a vision of trying to become the most sustainable protein company on earth. This involved assembling various initiatives into a purposeful journey for the enterprise.\n\n\u201cFrom that point forward, virtually everything we did was connected to this broad definition of sustainability,\u201d he notes. The company\u2019s ambitious goals were not just lofty statements but were integrated into the organization\u2019s core business strategy, guiding every decision and action, acting as a roadmap and serving as a benchmark against which progress could be measured.\n\nLeverage Expertise and Collaboration\n\nFrom there, McCain stresses the importance of working with external experts and stakeholders to drive sustainable initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe embraced a guy out of Harvard who\u2019s written a lot about this along with Michael Porter. His name\u2019s Mark Kramer. We had Mark Kramer in as an advisor on the topic,\u201d McCain shares. \u201cHe really opened our eyes to the difference between ESG and shared value propositions.\u201d (Kramer, it should be noted, is quite critical of ESG initiatives because many lack substance and are focused on risk or reputation management rather than creating tangible change.)\n\nMcCain adds by collaborating with external thought leaders and integrating their insights into plans of action, businesses can have greater confidence that their ESG strategies are effective.\n\nFocus on Integrity and Authenticity\n\nA significant challenge when developing ESG strategies is avoiding greenwashing \u2013 the practice of making misleading claims about the environmental benefits of a product or policy. Greenwashing can severely damage a company\u2019s reputation and erode trust with consumers, investors, and other stakeholders.\n\nThere is a real risk, McCain notes, that strategies can be developed to \u201ctick a box\u201d and, as a result, they\u2019ll \u201clack substance\u201d and won\u2019t drive \u201creal progress.\u201d\n\nTo counter this, McCain advocates for genuine, integrity-driven approaches that focus on solving real problems rather than just enhancing the company\u2019s image. He believes that authenticity in ESG practices not only builds trust with stakeholders but also drives long-term value creation.\n\nTo get there, businesses must ensure their ESG claims are backed by tangible actions and measurable results. Transparency is key; companies should regularly report on their ESG performance, including both successes and areas for improvement. Engaging third-party auditors to verify sustainability claims can further enhance credibility.\n\nEmbrace Continuous Improvement\n\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, McCain notes the journey towards sustainability is ongoing and requires continuous improvement. McCain points out that Maple Leaf Foods had years of leadership in environmental initiatives before going further to address social challenges by committing to their ambitious sustainability goals (including being a leading sustainable protein company).\n\n\u201cWe were already leaders in raising animals without antibiotics. We already had some of the leading-edge animal welfare practices in the world,\u201d he says.\n\nThis foundation allowed the company to build on its achievements and continually strive for better performance.\n\nBusinesses must recognize that ESG is not a one-time effort but a continuous process of assessment, improvement, and adaptation to new challenges and opportunities.\n\nContinuous improvement involves regularly reviewing and updating ESG strategies to reflect new insights, technologies, and stakeholder expectations. It requires a commitment to learning and innovation, as well as the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nBusinesses should establish processes for monitoring progress, gathering feedback, and making necessary adjustments.\n\nThis proactive approach helps to ensure that ESG strategies remain relevant and effective over time.\n\nBy adopting this focus, McCain notes, businesses can not only build greater stakeholder trust but also drive long-term value. And in an era where sustainability is becoming increasingly critical, businesses that prioritize impactful ESG strategies will be better positioned for success in the future.\n\n\u201cWe [have chosen to] be part of the solution\u2026 [the company\u2019s] belief system [and strategy have always aligned] with that.\u201d\n\nThings our lawyers want you to knowThings our lawyers want you to know This article is intended as general information only and is not to be relied upon as constituting legal, financial or other professional advice.

                "article_text": "A perfect storm is brewing in the food sector, driven by the dual challenges of climate change and nature loss. Rising temperatures, shifting water patterns, and damaged arable land are making it increasingly difficult to feed the world\u2019s growing population. With food security being a major risk, leaders around the world are now having to ask themselves: how can we build sustainable food systems with long-term stability in mind?\n\nAs the agriculture, forestry, and land use sectors account for nearly a quarter of global emissions, decarbonising these industries is key to preventing the worst effects of climate change. The intricate connections between land availability, biodiversity, and food production create a complex \u201cGordian Knot\u201d that requires effective collaboration and innovations like AI ESG software across sectors.\n\nThe path forward for sustainable food systems\n\nOne of the most pressing needs is to address the degradation of ecosystems, which directly impacts food production. According to Deloitte\u2019s Randy Jagt, advancing sustainable food systems involves more than just feeding the world. It\u2019s about embedding resilience into food systems, balancing nutritional demands, and maintaining the health of our ecosystems. Without healthy ecosystems, food security will remain elusive.\n\nFortunately, there are a number of innovative solutions and ideas which show promise and potential. Three main approaches have been identified: rethinking value chains, embracing precision agriculture and improving sustainable land use.\n\nSustainable land use and regenerative practices\n\nCountries like Morocco, Ethiopia, and Madagascar are leading the way in sustainable land use. For example, Morocco has increased rainwater absorption and reduced soil erosion, while Ethiopia has improved wheat yields using site-specific fertilisers. In Madagascar, vanilla farmers have successfully implemented agroforestry, helping to restore ecosystems and increase incomes.\n\nThese active approaches to tackling climate change show the sheer potential that regenerative practices hold in order to not only reduce emissions but also support ecosystems, providing a standard for other regions to follow.\n\nTransforming value chains and precision agriculture\n\nSimilarly to sustainable land use, reworking value chains could also significantly improve emission reduction and increase traceability of food production. Companies such as Maple Leaf Food have implemented nitrogen-based emissions tracking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and Natura & Co are working towards having deforestation-free supply chains.\n\nPrecision agriculture also plays a critical role in sustainable food systems. By using earth observation data and sensors, farmers can optimise water and fertiliser use, reducing costs and emissions while increasing yields. Precision agriculture could contribute as much as $400 billion to the global economy by 2030, proving its potential for both environmental and economic benefits.\n\nGlobal action and collaboration\n\nIn June, the G7 launched the Apulia Food Systems Initiative to develop systemic approaches to enhance food security and nutrition. This initiative, along with upcoming international meetings in Cali, Colombia, and Baku, Azerbaijan, aims to drive action at the global level. These efforts highlight the importance of collaboration among governments, corporations, and local communities to build resilient, sustainable food systems.\n\nFirms looking to get involved in sustainable food systems and improve their ESG performance should use ESG software such as IMPAKTER PRO, which can assist with tracking progress and reporting compliance.\n\n***\n\nThis article is referenced from Sustainable food systems: The path to global action | Trellis by Trellis\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The opinions expressed here by the authors are their own, not those of impakter.com \u2014 Cover Photo Credit: Dan Gold"

But to many, they also represent sustainable protein.\n\nCommercial Banking client Maple Leaf Foods is a meat- and plant-based protein brand that\u2019s working to become the most sustainable protein company in the world. And while the publicly traded company has over a century in meat production\u2014one of its predecessors even helped Toronto earn the nickname \u2018Hogtown\u2019\u2014Maple Leaf Foods is set on the future of the food industry.\n\nBuilding a New Food Model\n\nMaple Leaf\u2019s sustainability commitment is more than just words on a website or fancy packaging. This Mississauga, Ontario-headquartered client is taking its goal seriously, becoming the world\u2019s first major carbon-neutral food company in 2019 and the only food company in Canada to set Science Based Targets in 2019. One of those targets: reducing greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2030.\n\nTo meet that goal, Maple Leaf is building environmentally conscious production facilities, sustainably producing meat and offering plant-based proteins.\n\n\u201cThe day I knew that we became carbon-neutral and that our investments in so many high-impact projects throughout North America were doing their job to protect the planet was truly one of the most satisfying and proud days of my career,\u201d said Michael McCain, president and CEO of Maple Leaf Foods.\n\nThe company\u2019s sustainability efforts also ranked Maple Leaf second globally against meat, poultry, dairy and farmed fish companies in the FAIRR Initiative\u2019s 2020 Protein Producer Index and, along with just two other companies in the world, recognition as a \u201cLow Risk\u201d food producer.\n\nAs a \u201cfarm-to-fork\u201d company, Maple Leaf Foods recognizes the unique challenges raising livestock brings to managing its carbon footprint. Specifically, the company is working to reduce methane, the most significant source of greenhouse gas in its production processes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re exploring exciting approaches to capture methane and convert it to renewable natural gas, which fundamentally pivots our footprint,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe\u2019re also advancing our knowledge and practices in regenerative agriculture, which is a method of farming that focuses on improving each farm\u2019s resources, rather than depleting them. Some of our efforts include topsoil regeneration, improving the water cycle and increasing biodiversity.\"\n\nMaple Leaf is also finding new ways to make meat better. For McCain, \u201cmaking meat better\u201d means improving food quality while also increasing sustainability practices.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve renovated our products to use to simple ingredients that people can understand,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also focused on our animal care practices, like shifting to open sow housing, fitting our transport trucks with hydraulic lifts for pigs and shifting to climate-controlled trucks for chicken transport.\u201d\n\nMcCain hopes Maple Leaf\u2019s advancements will prove to other leaders that carbon neutrality is possible in the food industry.\n\n\u201cScience-based targets are possible\u2014and you can do all this and be profitable,\u201d McCain said. \u201cMost importantly, we don\u2019t want to stand alone as a carbon-neutral company and believer in science-based targets; we want to become part of an inclusive group of sustainability leaders who embrace these same initiatives.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a business strategy that goes beyond social responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe concept of shared value is part of our company\u2019s leadership values, where our business and social decisions are deeply intertwined,\u201d McCain said. \u201cOur social decisions consider business impact, and business decisions consider social impact. Within that framework, we view carbon neutrality as the correct social decision and the correct business decision, which creates a virtuous circle where social and business decisions reinforce one another.\u201d\n\nReaching that shared value framework was decades in the making, but it especially came into focus for McCain at a future of food discussion with global activists at a Davos luncheon. At that discussion, the activists predicted the demise of Maple Leaf\u2019s industry, McCain said.\n\n\u201cIgnoring existential threats of this climate change crisis, and our role in it, would be the ultimate act of negligence,\u201d McCain said. \u201cOur choices were clear: ignore the problems by defending what we were doing, or embrace the problem and change. But we also needed to make it worthwhile to shareholders by monetizing our environmental leadership where we possibly could.\u201d"

(TSX: MFI), today released its second annual Integrated Report, building on over a decade of sustainability reporting and bringing together its 2023 financial and sustainability performance into one report.\n\nIn his Letter to Stakeholders, Maple Leaf Foods' President and CEO, Curtis Frank, reflects on his first year as CEO. \"Perhaps our proudest accomplishment is that throughout a year of intense transition and disruption, our commitment to creating Shared Value for all our stakeholders has been unwavering,\" said Frank. \"We worked hard as a team to stabilize the financial performance of our business, realize the benefits of our recent capital investments and put the right plans and people in place to capitalize on the platform we have built for the future.\"\n\nMaple Leaf Foods is recognized as a purpose-driven, globally admired and brand-led CPG company with the vision to be the most sustainable protein company on Earth \u2014 an ambition it maintains through the execution of five core strategies outlined in its newly released, evolved Blueprint. The Company's core strategies are:\n\nLead the Way : By making better food, taking better care, and nurturing a better planet.\n\n: By making better food, taking better care, and nurturing a better planet.

Develop Extraordinary Talent: By embedding its values-based culture, investing in future ready leaders, and inspiring enduring engagement.\n\nSustainability vision\n\nMaple Leaf Foods' vision to be the most sustainable protein company on Earth is built on five pillars: Better Food, Better Care for Our People, Better Care for Communities, Better Animal Care, and a Better Planet. The Company tracks progress toward achieving its vision against these pillars, including the goals and milestones set along the way.\n\nBetter Food\n\nIn 2023, Maple Leaf Foods launched a new Maple Leaf Natural Selections\u00ae offering of deli meats with its simplest ingredients ever, proudly containing only premium meat and real, simple and natural ingredients, supporting its ambition to be a leader of the real food movement. The Company is also simplifying and increasing the legibility of its packaging with Maple Leaf-branded products with claims appearing on front of pack which are easier to read.\n\nThe Company proudly reports that multiple products within its portfolio ranked #1 in Canada, including: Schneiders\u00ae for packaged meats, the Mina Halal\u00ae brand in fresh poultry, Greenfield Natural Meat Co.\u00ae for sustainable packaged meats, and Maple Leaf Prime\u00ae for fresh poultry. Additionally, Maple Leaf\u00ae is the #2 brand in packaged meats in Canada, Field RoastTM is the #3 brand in the U.S. for refrigerated plant protein, and Lightlife\u00ae is the #1 brand in Tempeh, plant-based hot dogs, and plant-based bacon.\n\nBetter Care for Our People\n\nCaring for people, including ensuring their safety and well-being, is a key priority at Maple Leaf Foods. In 2023, the Company completed social compliance audits at its five largest facilities and moved forward with an enhanced social compliance program. The Company announced that it would be launching an independent third-party human rights impact assessment focusing on migrant workers within its workforce. Advancing the Company's social compliance programs, including conducting social audits and human rights impact assessments, are important elements of advancing social responsibility, compliance and human rights within operations and the supply chain.\n\nIn 2023, Maple Leaf Foods achieved a Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of 0.40, a 93.6% improvement from its 2012 baseline year, and 32 of its sites had zero recordable injuries. This reflects the Company's relentless commitment to workplace safety, its Safety Promise, and continuous improvement in safety protocols. In 2023, Maple Leaf Foods had zero fatalities, a trend that has continued for more than a decade.\n\nIn line with Maple Leaf Foods' Diversity and Inclusion Blueprint, the Company also developed new, impactful goals to advance diversity, promote equity, and maintain a steadfast focus on fostering an inclusive culture within the organization.\n\nBetter Care for Communities\n\nFor Maple Leaf Foods, enhancing community well-being is a core focus, extending from within the organization to the broader society.\n\nThe Maple Leaf Centre for Food Security (\"the Centre\") celebrated its seventh anniversary in 2023, having committed more than $12.4 million to 33 initiatives seeking to address underlying drivers of food insecurity that span coast-to-coast-to-coast. The Centre has also advocated for government policies and led awareness-raising campaigns to engage Canadians and drive systemic change. The Centre joined several Canadian foundations to provide funding for Ontario's Student Nutrition Program and First Nations Student Nutrition Program. Along with funds provided by the Government of Ontario, this effort contributed $5 million towards school food programs across the province.\n\nMaple Leaf Foods employees volunteered their time in more than 40 communities across Canada through the Company's Raise the Good in the Neighbourhood volunteer program. Employees volunteered with their local food banks, in healthcare institutions and hospitals, for local community centres, with newcomer services, and more, contributing to a greater understanding of the challenges and causes that groups are facing while building connections within communities.\n\nBetter Animal Care\n\nMaple Leaf Foods is proud to have completed the transition of its Ontario poultry processing operations to its new, world-class London Poultry facility. As part of this transition, the Company now uses humane controlled atmosphere stunning for all of the poultry it processes. The Company's poultry processing facilities are now all equipped with modular loading, best-in-class environmentally controlled indoor lairage, and technology that eliminates the need to handle birds before they are rendered insensible.\n\nIn 2023, Maple Leaf Foods published a comprehensive Poultry Welfare Approach which has 13 areas of focus to ensure the health and well-being of its chickens at all steps in the poultry supply chain. At the broiler level, areas of focus include environmental enrichments, lighting, stocking density, air and litter management, antibiotic use, breed, and humane euthanasia.\n\nMaple Leaf Foods remains committed to the elimination of gestation stalls for sows, and 100% of the Company's owned sow spaces meet open sow housing standards in accordance with the National Farm Animal Care Council (NFACC) Code of Practice and Canadian Pork Excellence PigCARE program. The Company achieved its leading goal of converting all owned sow spaces (69,850 sow spaces) to its Advanced Open Sow Housing system as of the end of 2021, which now represents 93% of our sow spaces following the Company's acquisition of additional sow barns.\n\nMaple Leaf Foods is deeply committed to reducing the use of antibiotics in its animals while ensuring animals receive treatment when needed to protect their welfare. In 2023, antibiotic use in the pigs Maple Leaf Foods raises continued trending downward. Since 2014, the Company has reduced antibiotic usage by 99.3% across its owned hog production operations.\n\nBetter Planet\n\nIn 2015, Maple Leaf Foods set targets to reduce its environmental footprint by 50% by 2025 (2014 baseline), in five key areas: electricity, natural gas, water, solid waste (2015 baseline) and food loss and waste (2016 baseline). The electricity and natural gas targets were considered interim targets on the path towards its science-based targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to reduce the Company's absolute Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 30% by 2030 (2018 baseline).\n\nWhile Maple Leaf Foods has made progress across these areas, the pace of progress has been hampered by a number of factors, including the impact of the global pandemic which delayed a number of initiatives, as well as the timing of ramping up its new facilities and the lag in decommissioning associated legacy plants. The Company recognizes the challenges associated with setting aggressive science-based targets and is committed to transparent updates on its progress towards these sustainability goals.\n\nIn 2023, Maple Leaf Foods was a founding member of the Canadian Alliance for Net-Zero Agri-Food (CANZA), a national, industry-led, multi-stakeholder alliance of RBC, Maple Leaf Foods, Nutrien, McCain Foods, Loblaw, BCG and The Natural Step Canada and the Smart Prosperity Institute in collaboration with the Arrell Food Institute at the University of Guelph. CANZA is committed to driving sustainable outcomes in Canada's agri-food sector. As an integral driver of the Canadian economy, this sector is also a significant emitter of greenhouse gas. CANZA promotes the adoption of regenerative agriculture and carbon farming practices, offering an opportunity to transform the sector and create a circular, net-zero agri-food supply value. By collaborating with farmers to achieve nature-positive outcomes, the alliance is committed to building a more sustainable future for agriculture.\n\nMaple Leaf Foods partnered with Nutrien, the world's largest provider of crop inputs, for the fourth consecutive year to expand regenerative agriculture efforts. Through Nutrien's carbon program, they support growers, drive sustainability, and boost profitability. This work aligns with the Company's goal of sourcing sustainable feed by reducing the carbon footprint of purchased crops. Maple Leaf Foods has doubled its investments in regenerative practices year over year for the past three years and has scaled its efforts from 19,000 acres to 160,000 acres.\n\nTo learn more about sustainability at Maple Leaf Foods, visit: https://www.mapleleaffoods.com/our-commitments/\n\nForward\u2013Looking Statements\n\nThis document contains, and the Company's oral and written public communications often contain, \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities law.

It\u2019s a business strategy to drive economic success and competitiveness.\u201d\n\nThe business strategy uses \u201cpolicies and operating practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company while simultaneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates. Shared value creation focuses on identifying and expanding the connections between societal and economic progress,\u201d according to the Shared Value Initiative.\n\n\u201cWhen you break down what shared value is all about for a food company, you have to reconfigure your products or enter into new markets to address social and environmental issues. You have to become very efficient within your supply chain,\u201d Faveri added.\n\nHe also stressed that a program like this takes deep and meaningful engagement from all levels of management in an organization, otherwise employees will view it as just another corporate strategy.\n\nBuilding on CSR and ESG\n\nShared value builds on the components of corporate social responsibility (CSR) or environmental, social, governance (ESG) programs.\n\nBrands use CSR programs to demonstrate good corporate citizenship, including environmental efforts, philanthropy, ethical labor practices and volunteering. ESG programs take it one step further by evaluating a variety of social concerns including diversity, employee relations, consumer protection and animal welfare.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that sustainability has evolved again. Companies have become purposeful,\u201d Faveri said. \u201cI think we can safely say that the terms CSR and triple bottom line are in the past and companies are now focusing on sustainability and focus.\u201d\n\nMaple Leaf Foods, according to its website, is a producer of food products under leading brands including Maple Leaf, Maple Leaf Prime, Maple Leaf Natural Selections, Schneider's, Country Naturals, Mina, Greenfield Natural Meat Co., Lightlife, Field Roast Grain Meat Co. and Swift.

We use these pillars to track our progress towards achieving our Vision and the goals and milestones we set along the way.\n\nWe\u2019re proud of the progress we\u2019ve made and the impact we\u2019re having, and we\u2019re excited to share our journey with you. Read on for key insights from our 2023 Integrated Report to learn more about our sustainability efforts and how we\u2019re working towards a better future for all.\n\nMaking better food for Canadians\n\nDid you know that in 2023, we launched a new Maple Leaf Natural Selections\u00ae offering of deli meats?\n\nMade with only premium meat and real, simple, and natural ingredients, our Natural Selections\u00ae deli meats show our commitment to lead the real food movement. We\u2019re also making our packaging easier to read and understand, with claims on the front of the pack so that you know exactly what you\u2019re purchasing and feeding to your family.\n\nWe\u2019re thrilled to share that multiple products under our Family of Brands ranked #1 in Canada! These include:\n\nSchneiders for Packaged Meats\n\nMina Halal brand in fresh poultry\n\nGreenfield for Sustainable Packaged Meats\n\nMaple Leaf Prime for fresh poultry.\n\nAnd Maple Leaf is the #2 brand in Packaged Meats in Canada, and in the U.S. for Refrigerated Plant Protein, Maple Leaf Foods is #1 in Tempeh, #1 in Hot Dogs, and #1 in Bacon. Our consumers \u2014 people just like you \u2014 are an integral part of this accomplishment and we\u2019re delighted that you continue to love and purchase our delicious protein products.\n\nWorkplace safety for our people\n\nAt Maple Leaf Foods, we care for our people \u2014 a lot! This includes protecting their safety and well-being at work. In 2023, we completed social compliance audits at our five biggest facilities and advanced an improved social compliance program. We also announced that we would initiate an independent third-party human rights impact assessment that focuses on migrant workers that we employ \u2014 an incredibly important part of our team. We believe that progressing our social compliance programs, like doing social audits and human rights impact assessments, are essential parts of enhancing our social responsibility, compliance, and human rights within our organization.\n\nAlso in 2023, we reached a Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of 0.40* which is a 93.6% improvement from our 2012 baseline year. That means that 32 of our sites had zero recordable injuries*. This reflects our unwavering commitment to workplace safety, our Safety Promise, and our ongoing improvement in safety protocols. Last year, we had zero fatalities \u2014 a trend that has lasted for more than a decade.\n\nDid you know that in addition to our strategic Blueprint, we also follow a Diversity and Inclusion Blueprint? We are proud to continually evolve new, impactful goals to advance our diversity, support equity, and keep a steady focus on creating an inclusive culture within our organization \u2014 it\u2019s just the right thing to do!\n\nVolunteering to build stronger communities\n\nWe\u2019re committed to improving the well-being of communities, both inside and outside of our four walls. In 2016, we created the Maple Leaf Centre for Food Security (AKA \u201cthe Centre\u201d) and since then, it has donated more $12.4 million to 33 projects that aim to tackle the root causes of food insecurity across Canada. The Centre has also advocated for government policies and led awareness-raising campaigns to involve Canadians and drive systemic change.\n\nWe also host the Raise the Good in the Neighbourhood volunteer program, where our Team Members get two paid days off per year to volunteer at the cause of their choice. Our Team Members volunteered their time in more than 40 communities across the country in places like local food banks, healthcare institutions and hospitals, local community centres, newcomer services, and more. We\u2019re proud that our people are contributing to a better understanding of the issues and needs that groups are facing while building connections within their communities.\n\nFostering our animal care practices\n\nWe are deeply committed to reduce the use of antibiotics in our animals while ensuring animals get treatment when needed. In 2023, antibiotic use in the pigs we raise continued to decline. Since 2014, we\u2019ve reduced antibiotic usage by 99.3% across our own hog production operations.\n\nAs of the end of 2021, we\u2019ve reached our goal of converting all owned sow spaces (69,850 sow spaces) to our Advanced Open Sow Housing system \u2014 which now represents 93% of our sow spaces after acquiring more sow barns.\n\nJoining forces to nurture a better planet\n\nBack in 2015, we set a goal to lower our environmental impact by 50% by 2025 (2014 baseline) in five key areas:\n\nElectricity\n\nNatural gas\n\nWater\n\nSolid waste (2015 baseline)\n\nFood loss and waste (2016 baseline).\n\nWhile we have made some improvements in these areas, we acknowledge that the speed of improvement has been slowed by various factors, like the effect of the global pandemic which postponed some initiatives, and the timing of starting up our new facilities and the delay in closing down related older plants. We know that there are some difficulties in setting ambitious science-based goals and we are dedicated to providing clear updates on our progress towards these sustainability objectives!\n\nWe do what we can today to create a better future for tomorrow. That\u2019s why we\u2019re proud members of the Canadian Alliance for Net-Zero Agri-Food (CANZA), a national, industry-led, multi-stakeholder alliance that was created in 2023. Founded by The Natural Step Canada and the Smart Prosperity Institute, and in collaboration with the Arrell Food Institute at the University of Guelph, Maple Leaf Foods participates in CANZA alongside RBC, Nutrien, McCain Foods, Loblaw, and BCG.\n\nThe agri-food sector is a vital part of Canada\u2019s economy, but it also produces a lot of greenhouse gas. CANZA works to support sustainable solutions in this sector, by encouraging farmers to use regenerative agriculture and carbon farming practices. These practices can help the sector become circular and net-zero, meaning that it does not create more emissions than it can remove. The alliance works with farmers to help them improve their natural environment, and to create a more sustainable future for agriculture.\n\nJoin us on our sustainability journey and let\u2019s Raise the Good in Food together!

                "article_text": "New online challenge engages families with simple at-home activities that convey the importance of regenerative agriculture\n\nMISSISSAUGA, ON, Oct. 30, 2024 /CNW/ - Maple Leaf Foods Inc. (TSX: MFI), the world's first major carbon neutral food company, continues to support Canadians with climate-friendly little changes that can collectively contribute to a better planet. November 7 marks the third annual Little Changes Day, established to celebrate Maple Leaf Foods' carbon neutral anniversary and encourage Canadians to partake in their own sustainability journey, by integrating eco-friendly habits into everyday routines.\n\nA recent survey1 from Maple Leaf Foods reveals nearly all Canadians (94%) care about protecting the environment and 84% agree that working together is important to turn the tide of climate change, yet many don't know where to start to make a difference. Maple Leaf Foods started Little Changes Day to inspire Canadians with simple and fun resources to help jumpstart Canadians' eco-friendly habits. This year, the Little Changes Day 'Grow Your Own Greens' challenge was developed in partnership with Earth Rangers, the kids' conservation organization. Accessible via the Earth Rangers App, the challenge teaches families about the importance of sustainable farming practices, through simple, eco-friendly at-home activities, including how to:\n\nGrow your own greens using kitchen scraps (e.g. using lettuce stalks and herb stems)\n\nCreate indoor planters using recycled materials\n\nSuccessfully plant indoors, with information on the best types of planters, soil, and veggies that grow best inside (e.g. lettuce, microgreens, herbs)\n\n\"Prioritizing sustainable choices to protect the environment is something we're committed to as part of our broader mission to 'Raise the Good in Food',\" says Joe McMahan, Vice President, Sustainability and Shared Value at Maple Leaf Foods. \"Little Changes Day is just one way in which we encourage Canadians to participate in our purposeful journey to better protect our planet and food supply.\"\n\n\"This year's 'Grow Your Own Greens' challenge shows families how eco-friendly farming practices can make a difference. Through knowledge and understanding, Canadians can help us to maintain Canada's food supply for future generations. Change can start from something as small as growing lettuce in your kitchen, to the solutions we're delivering on a much larger scale, such as regenerative agriculture practices within our supply chain to support our growers,\" says McMahan.\n\nPositive momentum for the planet\n\nThe third Little Changes Day builds on the momentum of ongoing resources and activities designed to provide eco-friendly tips for families looking for easy ways to practice sustainability. From learning how to curb household carbon emissions through 2022's Little Changes Home Challenge or conserving electricity and connecting with family through 2023's Disconnect to Reconnect Challenge, year-over-year, each activity has shown how easy and FUN combatting climate change can be.\n\nA partnership that's making a difference\n\nAs long-term supporters of Earth Rangers' mission, Maple Leaf Foods has collaborated on multiple initiatives that have empowered more than 200,000 members to take action for the planet. The latest Little Changes Day challenge is just one activity to be included within the wider Future Farmer Mission that explores how regenerative agriculture helps to improve soil health, fight climate change, and increase biodiversity to ensure plants and animals thrive. It has, to date, seen more than 3,000 completed actions.\n\n\"Teaching younger generations about the importance of protecting the environment in a fun and relatable way that encourages positive action helps give kids a sense of agency and confidence in their ability to make a difference in the fight against climate change,\" says Tovah Barocas, President of Earth Rangers. \"With organizations like Maple Leaf Foods' support, the Future Farmer Mission and new Grow Your Own Greens Challenge are increasing agricultural knowledge and access to fresh food among kids and families, while making the connection between the food we eat and broader sustainability issues.\"\n\nHow to take part\n\nThe Future Farmer Mission is available now, and the Grow Your Own Greens Challenge launches on November 7. Both are accessible for free through the Earth Rangers App.\n\nTo learn more about Maple Leaf Foods' commitment to environmental sustainability, visit MapleLeafFoods.com/our-commitments.\n\nAbout Maple Leaf Foods\n\nMaple Leaf Foods is a carbon neutral company with a vision to be the most sustainable protein company on earth, responsibly producing food products under leading brands including Maple Leaf\u00ae, Maple Leaf Prime\u00ae, Maple Leaf Natural Selections\u00ae, Schneiders\u00ae, Schneiders\u00ae Country Naturals\u00ae, Mina\u00ae, Greenfield Natural Meat Co. \u00ae, LightLife\u00ae and Field Roast\u2122.

                "article_text": "The corporate world is experiencing a shift toward Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategies, driven by increasing awareness of climate change, societal expectations, and the necessity for sustainable business practices.\n\nThe push for ESG strategies is seen not just as a matter of compliance but as good business stewardship, addressing the urgent need to adapt to evolving environmental and social conditions.\n\nDespite this, ESG strategies often face scrutiny and criticism for being superficial or mere public relations exercises, known as greenwashing.\n\nAs Michael McCain, the Executive Chair of Maple Leaf Foods notes, it\u2019s important to problem-solve for both commercial success and societal challenges by integrating ESG practices into their everyday workflows. It\u2019s something he\u2019s focused on bringing to life at one of Canada\u2019s largest producer of food products, and one he recently shared some thoughts on with leaders at RBC.\n\nHere are some of his key thoughts and takeaways.\n\nAdopt a Problem-Solving Mindset\n\nOne of the most critical first steps in developing an ESG strategy that will resonate with stakeholders is to adopt a problem-solving mindset \u2013 one that involves identifying core issues within a business that intersect with its operations.\n\nFor instance, companies in the agricultural sector might focus on sustainable farming practices to reduce their environmental footprint. Those in the manufacturing industry might prioritize energy efficiency and waste reduction.\n\nBy clearly defining the problems they aim to solve, businesses can create targeted and effective strategies that lead to meaningful outcomes. This approach shifts the focus from mere compliance to addressing real-world issues that affect both the business and its stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about actual problem solving and finding a way to define the problem in your landscape,\u201d McCain explains. \u201c[Solving for something] that\u2019s a multi-stakeholder problem and then transitioning that solution into something that\u2019s good for the enterprise is where the business strategy [can come in].\u201d\n\nSet Clear Goals\n\nOnce a problem has been identified, the goal for businesses should be to set clear goals. McCain notes, for him, this is paramount for any successful ESG strategy.\n\nMcCain notes that at Maple Leaf Foods, leaders committed to a vision of trying to become the most sustainable protein company on earth. This involved assembling various initiatives into a purposeful journey for the enterprise.\n\n\u201cFrom that point forward, virtually everything we did was connected to this broad definition of sustainability,\u201d he notes. The company\u2019s ambitious goals were not just lofty statements but were integrated into the organization\u2019s core business strategy, guiding every decision and action, acting as a roadmap and serving as a benchmark against which progress could be measured.\n\nLeverage Expertise and Collaboration\n\nFrom there, McCain stresses the importance of working with external experts and stakeholders to drive sustainable initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe embraced a guy out of Harvard who\u2019s written a lot about this along with Michael Porter. His name\u2019s Mark Kramer. We had Mark Kramer in as an advisor on the topic,\u201d McCain shares. \u201cHe really opened our eyes to the difference between ESG and shared value propositions.\u201d (Kramer, it should be noted, is quite critical of ESG initiatives because many lack substance and are focused on risk or reputation management rather than creating tangible change.)\n\nMcCain adds by collaborating with external thought leaders and integrating their insights into plans of action, businesses can have greater confidence that their ESG strategies are effective.\n\nFocus on Integrity and Authenticity\n\nA significant challenge when developing ESG strategies is avoiding greenwashing \u2013 the practice of making misleading claims about the environmental benefits of a product or policy. Greenwashing can severely damage a company\u2019s reputation and erode trust with consumers, investors, and other stakeholders.\n\nThere is a real risk, McCain notes, that strategies can be developed to \u201ctick a box\u201d and, as a result, they\u2019ll \u201clack substance\u201d and won\u2019t drive \u201creal progress.\u201d\n\nTo counter this, McCain advocates for genuine, integrity-driven approaches that focus on solving real problems rather than just enhancing the company\u2019s image. He believes that authenticity in ESG practices not only builds trust with stakeholders but also drives long-term value creation.\n\nTo get there, businesses must ensure their ESG claims are backed by tangible actions and measurable results. Transparency is key; companies should regularly report on their ESG performance, including both successes and areas for improvement. Engaging third-party auditors to verify sustainability claims can further enhance credibility.\n\nEmbrace Continuous Improvement\n\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, McCain notes the journey towards sustainability is ongoing and requires continuous improvement. McCain points out that Maple Leaf Foods had years of leadership in environmental initiatives before going further to address social challenges by committing to their ambitious sustainability goals (including being a leading sustainable protein company).\n\n\u201cWe were already leaders in raising animals without antibiotics. We already had some of the leading-edge animal welfare practices in the world,\u201d he says.\n\nThis foundation allowed the company to build on its achievements and continually strive for better performance.\n\nBusinesses must recognize that ESG is not a one-time effort but a continuous process of assessment, improvement, and adaptation to new challenges and opportunities.\n\nContinuous improvement involves regularly reviewing and updating ESG strategies to reflect new insights, technologies, and stakeholder expectations. It requires a commitment to learning and innovation, as well as the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nBusinesses should establish processes for monitoring progress, gathering feedback, and making necessary adjustments.\n\nThis proactive approach helps to ensure that ESG strategies remain relevant and effective over time.\n\nBy adopting this focus, McCain notes, businesses can not only build greater stakeholder trust but also drive long-term value. And in an era where sustainability is becoming increasingly critical, businesses that prioritize impactful ESG strategies will be better positioned for success in the future.\n\n\u201cWe [have chosen to] be part of the solution\u2026 [the company\u2019s] belief system [and strategy have always aligned] with that.\u201d\n\nThings our lawyers want you to knowThings our lawyers want you to know This article is intended as general information only and is not to be relied upon as constituting legal, financial or other professional advice.

                "article_text": "A perfect storm is brewing in the food sector, driven by the dual challenges of climate change and nature loss. Rising temperatures, shifting water patterns, and damaged arable land are making it increasingly difficult to feed the world\u2019s growing population. With food security being a major risk, leaders around the world are now having to ask themselves: how can we build sustainable food systems with long-term stability in mind?\n\nAs the agriculture, forestry, and land use sectors account for nearly a quarter of global emissions, decarbonising these industries is key to preventing the worst effects of climate change. The intricate connections between land availability, biodiversity, and food production create a complex \u201cGordian Knot\u201d that requires effective collaboration and innovations like AI ESG software across sectors.\n\nThe path forward for sustainable food systems\n\nOne of the most pressing needs is to address the degradation of ecosystems, which directly impacts food production. According to Deloitte\u2019s Randy Jagt, advancing sustainable food systems involves more than just feeding the world. It\u2019s about embedding resilience into food systems, balancing nutritional demands, and maintaining the health of our ecosystems. Without healthy ecosystems, food security will remain elusive.\n\nFortunately, there are a number of innovative solutions and ideas which show promise and potential. Three main approaches have been identified: rethinking value chains, embracing precision agriculture and improving sustainable land use.\n\nSustainable land use and regenerative practices\n\nCountries like Morocco, Ethiopia, and Madagascar are leading the way in sustainable land use. For example, Morocco has increased rainwater absorption and reduced soil erosion, while Ethiopia has improved wheat yields using site-specific fertilisers. In Madagascar, vanilla farmers have successfully implemented agroforestry, helping to restore ecosystems and increase incomes.\n\nThese active approaches to tackling climate change show the sheer potential that regenerative practices hold in order to not only reduce emissions but also support ecosystems, providing a standard for other regions to follow.\n\nTransforming value chains and precision agriculture\n\nSimilarly to sustainable land use, reworking value chains could also significantly improve emission reduction and increase traceability of food production. Companies such as Maple Leaf Food have implemented nitrogen-based emissions tracking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and Natura & Co are working towards having deforestation-free supply chains.\n\nPrecision agriculture also plays a critical role in sustainable food systems. By using earth observation data and sensors, farmers can optimise water and fertiliser use, reducing costs and emissions while increasing yields. Precision agriculture could contribute as much as $400 billion to the global economy by 2030, proving its potential for both environmental and economic benefits.\n\nGlobal action and collaboration\n\nIn June, the G7 launched the Apulia Food Systems Initiative to develop systemic approaches to enhance food security and nutrition. This initiative, along with upcoming international meetings in Cali, Colombia, and Baku, Azerbaijan, aims to drive action at the global level. These efforts highlight the importance of collaboration among governments, corporations, and local communities to build resilient, sustainable food systems.\n\nFirms looking to get involved in sustainable food systems and improve their ESG performance should use ESG software such as IMPAKTER PRO, which can assist with tracking progress and reporting compliance.\n\n***\n\nThis article is referenced from Sustainable food systems: The path to global action | Trellis by Trellis\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The opinions expressed here by the authors are their own, not those of impakter.com \u2014 Cover Photo Credit: Dan Gold"

But to many, they also represent sustainable protein.\n\nCommercial Banking client Maple Leaf Foods is a meat- and plant-based protein brand that\u2019s working to become the most sustainable protein company in the world. And while the publicly traded company has over a century in meat production\u2014one of its predecessors even helped Toronto earn the nickname \u2018Hogtown\u2019\u2014Maple Leaf Foods is set on the future of the food industry.\n\nBuilding a New Food Model\n\nMaple Leaf\u2019s sustainability commitment is more than just words on a website or fancy packaging. This Mississauga, Ontario-headquartered client is taking its goal seriously, becoming the world\u2019s first major carbon-neutral food company in 2019 and the only food company in Canada to set Science Based Targets in 2019. One of those targets: reducing greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2030.\n\nTo meet that goal, Maple Leaf is building environmentally conscious production facilities, sustainably producing meat and offering plant-based proteins.\n\n\u201cThe day I knew that we became carbon-neutral and that our investments in so many high-impact projects throughout North America were doing their job to protect the planet was truly one of the most satisfying and proud days of my career,\u201d said Michael McCain, president and CEO of Maple Leaf Foods.\n\nThe company\u2019s sustainability efforts also ranked Maple Leaf second globally against meat, poultry, dairy and farmed fish companies in the FAIRR Initiative\u2019s 2020 Protein Producer Index and, along with just two other companies in the world, recognition as a \u201cLow Risk\u201d food producer.\n\nAs a \u201cfarm-to-fork\u201d company, Maple Leaf Foods recognizes the unique challenges raising livestock brings to managing its carbon footprint. Specifically, the company is working to reduce methane, the most significant source of greenhouse gas in its production processes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re exploring exciting approaches to capture methane and convert it to renewable natural gas, which fundamentally pivots our footprint,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe\u2019re also advancing our knowledge and practices in regenerative agriculture, which is a method of farming that focuses on improving each farm\u2019s resources, rather than depleting them. Some of our efforts include topsoil regeneration, improving the water cycle and increasing biodiversity.\"\n\nMaple Leaf is also finding new ways to make meat better. For McCain, \u201cmaking meat better\u201d means improving food quality while also increasing sustainability practices.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve renovated our products to use to simple ingredients that people can understand,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also focused on our animal care practices, like shifting to open sow housing, fitting our transport trucks with hydraulic lifts for pigs and shifting to climate-controlled trucks for chicken transport.\u201d\n\nMcCain hopes Maple Leaf\u2019s advancements will prove to other leaders that carbon neutrality is possible in the food industry.\n\n\u201cScience-based targets are possible\u2014and you can do all this and be profitable,\u201d McCain said. \u201cMost importantly, we don\u2019t want to stand alone as a carbon-neutral company and believer in science-based targets; we want to become part of an inclusive group of sustainability leaders who embrace these same initiatives.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a business strategy that goes beyond social responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe concept of shared value is part of our company\u2019s leadership values, where our business and social decisions are deeply intertwined,\u201d McCain said. \u201cOur social decisions consider business impact, and business decisions consider social impact. Within that framework, we view carbon neutrality as the correct social decision and the correct business decision, which creates a virtuous circle where social and business decisions reinforce one another.\u201d\n\nReaching that shared value framework was decades in the making, but it especially came into focus for McCain at a future of food discussion with global activists at a Davos luncheon. At that discussion, the activists predicted the demise of Maple Leaf\u2019s industry, McCain said.\n\n\u201cIgnoring existential threats of this climate change crisis, and our role in it, would be the ultimate act of negligence,\u201d McCain said. \u201cOur choices were clear: ignore the problems by defending what we were doing, or embrace the problem and change. But we also needed to make it worthwhile to shareholders by monetizing our environmental leadership where we possibly could.\u201d"

Develop Extraordinary Talent: By embedding its values-based culture, investing in future ready leaders, and inspiring enduring engagement.\n\nSustainability vision\n\nMaple Leaf Foods' vision to be the most sustainable protein company on Earth is built on five pillars: Better Food, Better Care for Our People, Better Care for Communities, Better Animal Care, and a Better Planet. The Company tracks progress toward achieving its vision against these pillars, including the goals and milestones set along the way.\n\nBetter Food\n\nIn 2023, Maple Leaf Foods launched a new Maple Leaf Natural Selections\u00ae offering of deli meats with its simplest ingredients ever, proudly containing only premium meat and real, simple and natural ingredients, supporting its ambition to be a leader of the real food movement. The Company is also simplifying and increasing the legibility of its packaging with Maple Leaf-branded products with claims appearing on front of pack which are easier to read.\n\nThe Company proudly reports that multiple products within its portfolio ranked #1 in Canada, including: Schneiders\u00ae for packaged meats, the Mina Halal\u00ae brand in fresh poultry, Greenfield Natural Meat Co.\u00ae for sustainable packaged meats, and Maple Leaf Prime\u00ae for fresh poultry. Additionally, Maple Leaf\u00ae is the #2 brand in packaged meats in Canada, Field RoastTM is the #3 brand in the U.S. for refrigerated plant protein, and Lightlife\u00ae is the #1 brand in Tempeh, plant-based hot dogs, and plant-based bacon.\n\nBetter Care for Our People\n\nCaring for people, including ensuring their safety and well-being, is a key priority at Maple Leaf Foods. In 2023, the Company completed social compliance audits at its five largest facilities and moved forward with an enhanced social compliance program. The Company announced that it would be launching an independent third-party human rights impact assessment focusing on migrant workers within its workforce. Advancing the Company's social compliance programs, including conducting social audits and human rights impact assessments, are important elements of advancing social responsibility, compliance and human rights within operations and the supply chain.\n\nIn 2023, Maple Leaf Foods achieved a Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of 0.40, a 93.6% improvement from its 2012 baseline year, and 32 of its sites had zero recordable injuries. This reflects the Company's relentless commitment to workplace safety, its Safety Promise, and continuous improvement in safety protocols. In 2023, Maple Leaf Foods had zero fatalities, a trend that has continued for more than a decade.\n\nIn line with Maple Leaf Foods' Diversity and Inclusion Blueprint, the Company also developed new, impactful goals to advance diversity, promote equity, and maintain a steadfast focus on fostering an inclusive culture within the organization.\n\nBetter Care for Communities\n\nFor Maple Leaf Foods, enhancing community well-being is a core focus, extending from within the organization to the broader society.\n\nThe Maple Leaf Centre for Food Security (\"the Centre\") celebrated its seventh anniversary in 2023, having committed more than $12.4 million to 33 initiatives seeking to address underlying drivers of food insecurity that span coast-to-coast-to-coast. The Centre has also advocated for government policies and led awareness-raising campaigns to engage Canadians and drive systemic change. The Centre joined several Canadian foundations to provide funding for Ontario's Student Nutrition Program and First Nations Student Nutrition Program. Along with funds provided by the Government of Ontario, this effort contributed $5 million towards school food programs across the province.\n\nMaple Leaf Foods employees volunteered their time in more than 40 communities across Canada through the Company's Raise the Good in the Neighbourhood volunteer program. Employees volunteered with their local food banks, in healthcare institutions and hospitals, for local community centres, with newcomer services, and more, contributing to a greater understanding of the challenges and causes that groups are facing while building connections within communities.\n\nBetter Animal Care\n\nMaple Leaf Foods is proud to have completed the transition of its Ontario poultry processing operations to its new, world-class London Poultry facility. As part of this transition, the Company now uses humane controlled atmosphere stunning for all of the poultry it processes. The Company's poultry processing facilities are now all equipped with modular loading, best-in-class environmentally controlled indoor lairage, and technology that eliminates the need to handle birds before they are rendered insensible.\n\nIn 2023, Maple Leaf Foods published a comprehensive Poultry Welfare Approach which has 13 areas of focus to ensure the health and well-being of its chickens at all steps in the poultry supply chain. At the broiler level, areas of focus include environmental enrichments, lighting, stocking density, air and litter management, antibiotic use, breed, and humane euthanasia.\n\nMaple Leaf Foods remains committed to the elimination of gestation stalls for sows, and 100% of the Company's owned sow spaces meet open sow housing standards in accordance with the National Farm Animal Care Council (NFACC) Code of Practice and Canadian Pork Excellence PigCARE program. The Company achieved its leading goal of converting all owned sow spaces (69,850 sow spaces) to its Advanced Open Sow Housing system as of the end of 2021, which now represents 93% of our sow spaces following the Company's acquisition of additional sow barns.\n\nMaple Leaf Foods is deeply committed to reducing the use of antibiotics in its animals while ensuring animals receive treatment when needed to protect their welfare. In 2023, antibiotic use in the pigs Maple Leaf Foods raises continued trending downward. Since 2014, the Company has reduced antibiotic usage by 99.3% across its owned hog production operations.\n\nBetter Planet\n\nIn 2015, Maple Leaf Foods set targets to reduce its environmental footprint by 50% by 2025 (2014 baseline), in five key areas: electricity, natural gas, water, solid waste (2015 baseline) and food loss and waste (2016 baseline). The electricity and natural gas targets were considered interim targets on the path towards its science-based targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to reduce the Company's absolute Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 30% by 2030 (2018 baseline).\n\nWhile Maple Leaf Foods has made progress across these areas, the pace of progress has been hampered by a number of factors, including the impact of the global pandemic which delayed a number of initiatives, as well as the timing of ramping up its new facilities and the lag in decommissioning associated legacy plants. The Company recognizes the challenges associated with setting aggressive science-based targets and is committed to transparent updates on its progress towards these sustainability goals.\n\nIn 2023, Maple Leaf Foods was a founding member of the Canadian Alliance for Net-Zero Agri-Food (CANZA), a national, industry-led, multi-stakeholder alliance of RBC, Maple Leaf Foods, Nutrien, McCain Foods, Loblaw, BCG and The Natural Step Canada and the Smart Prosperity Institute in collaboration with the Arrell Food Institute at the University of Guelph. CANZA is committed to driving sustainable outcomes in Canada's agri-food sector. As an integral driver of the Canadian economy, this sector is also a significant emitter of greenhouse gas. CANZA promotes the adoption of regenerative agriculture and carbon farming practices, offering an opportunity to transform the sector and create a circular, net-zero agri-food supply value. By collaborating with farmers to achieve nature-positive outcomes, the alliance is committed to building a more sustainable future for agriculture.\n\nMaple Leaf Foods partnered with Nutrien, the world's largest provider of crop inputs, for the fourth consecutive year to expand regenerative agriculture efforts. Through Nutrien's carbon program, they support growers, drive sustainability, and boost profitability. This work aligns with the Company's goal of sourcing sustainable feed by reducing the carbon footprint of purchased crops. Maple Leaf Foods has doubled its investments in regenerative practices year over year for the past three years and has scaled its efforts from 19,000 acres to 160,000 acres.\n\nTo learn more about sustainability at Maple Leaf Foods, visit: https://www.mapleleaffoods.com/our-commitments/\n\nForward\u2013Looking Statements\n\nThis document contains, and the Company's oral and written public communications often contain, \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities law.

                "article_text": "A growing number of scientists concur: The climate crisis cannot be effectively addressed without a major reduction in global meat consumption. That may be why a recent announcement from Canada\u2019s largest meat company caught some by surprise.\n\nIn November, Maple Leaf Foods announced that it was \u201ccarbon neutral.\u201d The company, which owns 18 brands of pork and poultry products, also said it was setting science-based targets to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2030.\n\nWhile the company has received press coverage hailing its bold climate commitments, a closer look raises important questions about the claim, and what it means more broadly to claim carbon neutrality.\n\nMuch of the recent debate surrounding animal agriculture and climate change has focused on whether grazing animals in pastured systems can sequester carbon to a degree that reduces meat\u2019s overall emissions. But Maple Leaf is taking a different tack in arguing that the environmental damage done by factory farming can be counteracted with strategic investments.\n\n\u201cAs a large global meat company, we recognize that we\u2019re part of this big global problem that we face in society, and we want to be part of the solution,\u201d Randy Huffman, Maple Leaf\u2019s chief food safety and sustainability officer, told Civil Eats. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve done enough work in this to know that meat can be produced more sustainably.\u201d\n\nMaple Leaf is primarily a meat processing company, and while it is offsetting 100 percent of the emissions from company operations\u2014such as its electricity use and transportation\u2014its offset program for the emissions generated by its supply chain is more complex, and covers a portion of its supply chain\u2019s emissions.\n\nAnd while the company has committed to reducing some emissions in its animal agriculture supply chain, its targets for reducing those emissions are weaker.\n\nMaple Leaf Foods\u2019 annual revenue in 2018 was more than $2.6 billion, and the majority of its sales appear to be of pork and chicken products made from animals raised in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). These systems are known for being carbon intensive (although they have a smaller footprint than beef and dairy CAFOs) and for various other negative environmental impacts, including local air and water pollution from animal waste.\n\nThe company notes that Canada\u2019s animal agriculture industry typically operates on a smaller scale compared to the U.S. Maple Leaf says its hog-finishing barns each hold around 2,000 pigs in confinement.\n\n\u201cThis is a greenwashing effort top to bottom, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d said Andrew deCoriolis, executive director of Farm Forward. DeCoriolis was initially intrigued to see Maple Leaf taking the climate crisis seriously; then he dug into information on the company\u2019s practices and promises. \u201cTheir farms and production methods are going to be huge emitters of greenhouse gases,\u201d he says, noting that those largely fall outside the scope of Maple Leaf\u2019s commitments.\n\nSujatha Bergen, the director of health campaigns at the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), was less critical. The fact that the company is acknowledging the issue and that it was using science-based metrics to create a plan gives her some hope. \u201cIt\u2019s also great that they aren\u2019t using the fact that beef is a bigger emitter [than pork or poultry] to let themselves off the hook,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that all companies are doing, so I think they do deserve lots of credit.\u201d\n\nAfter further discussions with Maple Leaf, the company offered some clarifications to Civil Eats about its offset program and calculations. Tim Faveri, Maple Leaf\u2019s vice president of sustainability, says that the company models the emissions from its suppliers based on its own hog operations, and offsets the portion of those suppliers\u2019 production that Maple Leaf purchases."
