            "article_text": "ATLANTA, Georgia, and LONDON, UK, June 18, 2024 -- Descartes Systems Group (Nasdaq:DSGX) (TSX:DSG), the global leader in uniting logistics-intensive businesses in commerce, announced that U.K.-based merchant Scott Parnell has improved customer experience, operational efficiency and delivery sustainability by using Descartes\u2019 electronic proof of delivery (ePOD) software to distribute supplies and materials to construction, rail and infrastructure sectors on a national scale. Implementing Descartes\u2019 ePOD has contributed to a significant reduction in paper usage and productivity gains equal to two full-time employees.\n\n\n\n\u201cProviding our customers with reliable and efficient service has formed the backbone of our successful growth since 2012,\u201d said Rachael Adamson, Director \u2013 South-East, Scott Parnell. \u201cIntroducing Descartes\u2019 ePOD has translated into substantial daily savings of 16.5 staff hours as a result of more efficient customer delivery and invoice processes, allowing us to devote more time and attention to other initiatives that deliver greater value for our customers. The solution confirms that goods have been delivered, efficiently completes delivery notes, and emails the proof of delivery and invoice to the customer. Additionally, by replacing paper invoices with digital ones when delivering products, we will save on average 600 \u2013 1000 pieces of paper each day, contributing towards our own Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals and customer requirements.\u201d\n\n\n\nPart of Descartes\u2019 routing, mobile and telematics solution suite, ePOD captures customer and delivery information with supporting images and signatures via a mobile app. Since information is transmitted in real-time, invoicing errors are minimised. With at-stop data gathering, the solution streamlines business processes by eliminating the need for paper and printing, which reduces costs and supports environmental objectives. Furthermore, ePOD integrates with ERP systems, such as Hansa which is used by Scott Parnell, allowing organisations to achieve more accurate inventory management and invoicing. Finally, the system contributes towards health and safety initiatives, as it provides essential information about delivery sites, such as the need for drivers to wear protective equipment (e.g., high-visibility vest) upon delivery.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been rewarding to see how Scott Parnell has made strides in its customer experience and operations by implementing Descartes\u2019 ePOD software,\u201d said Gary Taylor, VP Sales, EMEA, Descartes. \u201cOur ePOD solution eliminates paper delivery notes and invoicing to minimise paperwork associated with last mile delivery. By digitising this process, Scott Parnell has freed up time for its team to focus on other business priorities and achieved accurate proof of delivery, invoicing and inventory management, and ESG gains.\u201d\n\n\n\nLearn more about Descartes\u2019 Routing, Mobile and Telematics Solutions.\n\n\n\nAbout Scott Parnell\n\nScott Parnell is an independent merchant made up of two specialist businesses, Rouden Pipetek, supplying Drainage and Pipework into the Construction, Civil and agriculture sectors and Scott Parnell, supplying products into the Civil, rail, geotechnics and water management industry supplied through local and national contractors.\n\nScott Parnell was built to be different \u2013 an independent partner to help customers make informed choices and find the right products from across the entire market.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nA flurry of climate disclosure regulations has prompted many public companies to integrate ESG into their corporate planning, risk management and governance strategies and invest in sustainability reporting technology, according to a report Deloitte released earlier this month.\n\nThe report \u2014 which surveyed 300 senior business leaders at companies generating at least $500 million in revenue \u2014 found that nearly all respondents were making ESG reporting a priority, with 98% meeting quarterly to discuss sustainability goals and 43% meeting at least once per month. Half of the respondents also said they were tapping into new resources to enhance reporting and measurement of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe findings indicated an increase in the appointment of chief sustainability officers and general counsel teams responsible for sustainability reporting within companies, up 13% and 41% respectively from 2022, pointing to a trend of company representatives \u201ctaking on elevated responsibilities\u201d for disclosure requirements.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe accounting firm, which conducted the survey in January, found 49% of respondents were conducting sustainability oversight by including ESG in the companies\u2019 disclosure committee review while 48% were adjusting and accelerating reporting timelines.\n\nRespondents almost unanimously \u2014 98% \u2014 said they had seen their company make progress toward sustainability goals set last year. Of these, 25% reported \u201csignificant progress,\u201d 60% reported \u201cmoderate progress,\u201d while 14% reported \u201cminimal progress.\u201d Nearly all respondents indicated they were preparing for increased disclosure requirements.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission passed its highly anticipated climate risk disclosure rule with a 3-2 vote in March, but decided to stay the rule in April as it works through legal challenges. Though the rule\u2019s implementation is currently halted, it is just one of a myriad of climate regulations American corporations must potentially comply with moving forward. This includes disclosure requirements put forward by California\u2019s two climate bills \u2014 Senate Bills 253 and 261 \u2014 and frameworks like the European Union\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.\n\nWhile survey respondents exhibited an overall growth in sustainable strategies to support their emissions reporting capabilities, the findings also pointed to a decline in executives\u2019 commitment to invest in new technology or tools to allow for more \u201ctimely and higher-quality\u201d disclosures. In 2024, only 74% of respondents said they would make such tech investments, down from 99% in 2022.\n\nHowever, Deloitte said this decline might be due to some companies having already made such investments toward reporting mechanisms and technology over the past few years.\n\nBusiness leaders surveyed represented industries such as financial services; consumer products; oil and gas; life sciences and health care; technology, media and telecommunications."

            "article_text": "Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword. It's a critical aspect of business that all companies need to prioritize, as there is increasing pressure from investors and new regulatory legislation, and customers who are becoming increasingly aware of companies\u2019 environmental impact. In fact, 24% of total estimated deaths are linked to the environment, which gives a lot of attention to this matter.\n\nCompanies need to manage sustainability effectively, but they face many obstacles, such as data availability, data and systems complexity, deep supply chain networks, and teams that tend to work in silos using tribal knowledge.\n\nManaging data is one of the biggest sustainability challenges companies are grappling with (this is true even among those who have been on the sustainability journey for some time). This challenge is mainly driven by the intrinsic complexity that surrounds the data required to manage sustainability, as most of the data needed comes from their rather opaque and complex supply chain networks. Given this paradigm, it is only natural for companies to begin managing sustainability from a supply chain lens.\n\nIn order to effectively combine sustainability and supply chain disciplines, companies will need to deploy symbiotic systems to connect these two realms. Investing in technology, for instance, is a great way to tackle sustainability data related problems, such as visibility of data for all points in the supply chain and reducing environmental issues such as GHG emissions, water stress, and waste. There is a myriad of technological options that companies can choose from. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one such technology that can help identify trends and patterns, enabling enhanced capabilities from recognizing hotspots and risks in their supply chain all the way to writing their voluntary disclosures and regulatory compliance reports. Another useful technology is Cloud software. Applications in this technology can map the supply chain, assimilating data from a diverse array of enterprise systems into a single, comprehensive digital twin. Companies can then create simulations and scenarios to assess investment alternatives to address sustainability challenges, while balancing critical supply chain performance metrics.\n\nWith the right technological investments, companies can move beyond collecting and reporting on historical data to drive transformative action by incorporating ESG metrics into their operating models. This visibility allows decision-makers to make better-informed decisions and, more importantly, incorporates all relevant stakeholders at the decision-making table. Some of the decisions that companies can make when they incorporate ESG metrics into the operating model are to find flexible production locations with more sustainable performance closer to demand, or reshore production to increase flexibility and sustainability in their manufacturing decisions. In fact, according to an MIT review article, the use of technologies in this space has made it possible for companies to break ties with cost-reducing dependencies and begin looking to increase service levels together with sustainability metrics.\n\nSupplier engagement and collaboration are also critical components of sustainability strategies, and technology is a powerful ally in boosting efficiency and success in these practices. For instance, technology can help standardize and streamline interactions with suppliers, freeing planners and managers to dedicate more time to managing their supplier relationships, devising sustainability initiatives, and better collaborating with their stakeholders. In the supplier engagement space, there is often something called \"supplier fatigue,\" as suppliers receive multiple requests from customers to fill out surveys on sustainability data. The biggest pain point is that most of these requests are not standardized, and it takes a lot of resources to process the data requests. Although technology can certainly help streamline data acquisition and analysis by leveraging connections to various data sources and harmonizing different types of data, it can also enable companies to segment and target their supplier management more effectively. By moving beyond a transactional and process-driven relationship with suppliers, technology can help companies customize their approach and generate more value. Additionally, real-time data acquisition and analysis facilitated by technology can make it easier for suppliers to adopt new practices by offering different engagement types tailored to their level of maturity.\n\nInnovative companies are leading the way toward a sustainable future. By making the right investments in technology and process changes, these companies are gaining an advantage in the sustainability race. They are also giving a voice to sustainability teams in traditionally operational spaces, which raises the sustainability agenda a step further than the conventional compliance, reporting, and marketing status quo. Technology can help companies address the challenges they face in managing sustainability by providing visibility into the supply chain, reducing environmental and social issues, and even helping with supplier engagement and collaboration. Moreover, investing in technology not only favors sustainability but also creates overall value for the company. Investing in sustainability and technology is a win-win strategy for companies and the environment."

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMicrosoft has launched a decarbonization team focused on reducing emissions from its supply chain, a move that builds on the tech giant\u2019s sustainability strategy and sustainable solutions suite.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s director of sustainability overseeing cloud operations and innovation, Charlie Sellars, announced the news in a LinkedIn post. The three-member team will help Microsoft tackle scope 3 emissions generated by purchased goods and services, as well as those produced by its cloud and artificial intelligence operations, per Sellars.\n\nThe three appointees include an in-house Microsoft veteran Tim Hopper, who has worked at the company for over two decades, along with Google\u2019s former senior manager for cloud services sustainability Ray Waweru and Meta\u2019s former net-zero lead Sofia Khan, according to the post.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nHopper previously served as Microsoft\u2019s cloud supply chain sustainability manager, a role he took on after working as the computer software provider\u2019s responsible sourcing manager. The responsible sourcing role involved managing a global responsible sourcing and ESG program for Microsoft\u2019s procurement and supply chain network, according to Hopper\u2019s LinkedIn.\n\nWaweru\u2019s time at Google included serving as the search engine company\u2019s sustainable procurement lead, and he worked as sustainable sourcing and ESG reporting manager at workspace solutions company WeWork before that. Waweru also has experience as a supply chain analyst at the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nKhan comes to Microsoft after almost four years as Meta\u2019s net-zero lead, a position she took on after working as a sustainability manager at Quantis, a Boston Consulting Group owned environmental sustainability consultancy that guides companies on their sustainability journey.\n\nThe creation of the decarbonization team falls in line with Microsoft\u2019s goal to become carbon negative by 2030 and joins a spate of recent initiatives the company has undertaken to mitigate its carbon footprint and work toward its sustainability targets. Among its goals, the company aims to slash over half of its own emissions \u2014 both direct and supply chain emissions \u2014 by the end of the decade.\n\nThis year alone, Microsoft\u2019s actions include expanding its sustainability suite with an ESG reporting tool and signing a landmark carbon removal contract with Stockholm Exergi, a 6-year offtake agreement with Catona Climate and a renewable energy credits purchase agreement with Recurrent Energy.\n\nDespite making headwinds in its sustainability strategy, Microsoft\u2019s chief sustainability officer Melanie Nakagawa and vice chair and president Brad Smith noted in its latest sustainability report that scope 3 or indirect emissions are an area where the company is \u201cnot yet on track\u201d but is working to \u201cidentify and pursue additional breakthroughs.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s scope 3 emissions \u2014 which account for 96% of the company\u2019s total emissions \u2014 increased to 16,624,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2023, up by over 3% from 2022, according to the report."

This industry-first offering addresses compliance reporting and puts companies on a path to measure and report the sustainability of their new product design and sourcing decisions.\n\nThe new capability is being introduced as new European Union regulations and evolving U.S. rules are forcing manufacturers to identify how to quantify and report their supply chain emissions. To date, electronics manufacturers have focused on reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions to comply with such regulations and their corporate sustainability goals. However, an estimated 40% of the CO2 emissions associated with electronics products are Scope 3 emissions, which are related to supplier manufacturing process, material consumption, and transportation modes. Until today, companies had little to no information about CO2 emissions associated with the electronics components they buy. This has created a troublesome blind spot for global manufacturers seeking to measure product carbon footprint for electronics content embedded in their innovation portfolios.\n\n\u201cUntil now, engineers designing new products and procurement teams tasked with obtaining components for those products have had no way to evaluate the CO2 emissions of a new design or purchasing decision,\u201d says Supplyframe CEO and founder Steve Flagg. \u201cThis capability gives them specific product carbon footprint details to meet regulatory reporting requirements and, ultimately, identify better alternatives that balance corporate goals of efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability.\u201d\n\nKey Takeaways:"

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nApparel companies Gap Inc., H&M Group, Mango and Bestseller joined an initiative to decarbonize the fashion sector and slash emissions within its supply chain, the group announced Thursday.\n\nThe Future Supplier Initiative offers brands financing models and technical support to help their suppliers transition to low carbon technologies and implement renewable energy solutions at the factory level. The program seeks to assist both brands and suppliers in meeting their climate targets and limiting global temperature rise to the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold set by the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe initiative \u2014 backed by The Fashion Pact, Apparel Impact Institute, consultancy firm Guidehouse and DBS Bank \u2014 will launch its pilot program in Bangladesh with support from the new quartet of signees. The companies will help provide expertise in building technical proposals, lowering lending risk to suppliers and implementing sustainability measures at \u201cmore attractive rates,\u201d per last week\u2019s release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs most of the fashion industry\u2019s emissions stem from its supply chain, the Future Supplier Initiative aims to expedite companies\u2019 pathway to net-zero status by highlighting the \u201cfinancial risks and responsibilities\u201d associated with shifting to clean energy sources. The initiative aims to provide this guidance to targeted garment and textile businesses that are direct suppliers, responsible for assembling and manufacturing the final product \u2014 known as Tier 1 \u2014 and factories that are subcontractors, supplying fabrics and materials to those that put the final product together \u2014 known as Tier 2.\n\nThe fashion industry and its supply chain are the world\u2019s third largest polluter, according to a 2021 World Economic Forum report. A separate study from the European Parliament found the sector emitted almost 10% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions annually, more than those generated by international flights and maritime shipping combined.\n\n\u201cThe cost of inaction on climate change is unaffordable,\u201d Eva von Alvensleben, The Fashion Impact\u2019s executive director, said in a release. \u201cIf the fashion sector is to meet its goals and transform its supply chain, we urgently need to address the gap between ambition and action.\u201d\n\nVon Alvensleben said no single company alone can bridge this gap, but several of them can come together to \u201cbuild an ecosystem of solutions\u201d by \u201csharing the costs, risks and responsibilities of the transition to renewable energy.\u201d\n\nThe Future Supplier Initiative said it aims to cut the price tag that often comes with the adoption of renewable energy solutions for suppliers by collaborating with fashion companies to reduce the cost of capital and loans. In addition to financial assistance, the initiative will also help suppliers identify and implement sustainable tech and solutions that reduce the business\u2019s reliance on carbon.\n\nThe initiative will monitor the emissions reductions brought by such measures to demonstrate the overall impact of the projects it supports and helps implement, both on the factory level and the supplier level.\n\nWhile the first iteration of the program will launch in Bangladesh, the initiative is \u201cactively recruiting\u201d more brands and intends to expand its project to \u201cother key manufacturing regions,\u201d such as China, Vietnam, India, Italy and Turkey, according to the release."

            "article_text": "Sustainability is becoming increasingly important to consumers. There is also more emphasis on companies reporting the impact they have on the environment. In Descartes\u2019 2023 consumer sentiment study on home delivery sustainability, 41% of respondents indicated they regularly or always make purchasing decisions based upon the product or company\u2019s environmental impact. Freight transportation (i.e., over-the-road, ocean, rail and air) is one of the top causes of greenhouse gas emissions, representing 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. With an increasing spotlight on the environment, these were added to Descartes 7th Annual Global Transportation Management Benchmark Study.\n\nDescartes divided transportation sustainability efforts into four categories from no action to a daily concern, and the overall response showed that 31% of respondents indicated they did nothing, 19% reported on their transportation carbon footprint, 27% factored it into their strategic plans and 22% made sustainability a component of their daily transportation decisions (see Figure 1). One way to look at the data is that 50% don\u2019t do anything with respect to sustainability in transportation, as only reporting doesn\u2019t mean that any actions were taken; however, 50% are doing something.\n\nFigure 1: Importance of sustainability in transportation\n\ndescartes\n\n\n\nThen the question was looked at through the lens of management\u2019s view of the importance of transportation management and company financial performance to see if companies where management thought transportation was a competitive weapon (see Figure 2) and were better financial performers (see Figure 3) were more engaged in sustainability efforts in transportation. Those companies whose management thought transportation management was a competitive weapon (57%) were much more likely to be taking action compared to only 48% who thought transportation management was not important. For financial performance, the numbers were similar with 58% of the top performers taking action vs. 44% of poorer performers.\n\nFigure 2: Respondents categorized by importance of transportation management to senior management\n\ndescartes\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Respondents categorized by financial performance\n\ndescartes\n\n\n\nThese differences in action around sustainability for management who recognize the value of transportation management and top financial performers versus other respondents make sense. In the benchmark study, we see these respondents more interested in strategies and actions that improve transportation management performance\u2014and most transportation management improvement programs have a positive and measurable impact on the environment.\n\nSignificant positive environmental impact can come from taking technology-enabled actions to improve transportation efficiency and transform paper-based processes. Logistics efficiency programs reduce CO2 footprint with technology solutions that consolidate shipments to reduce the distance and fuel required to deliver them; select transportation modes to use more efficient shipping options, which results in less fuel consumed; and facilitate backhaul shipment planning to reduce \u201cempty\u201d distance driven, driving greater carrier productivity and minimizing wasted fuel. AI- and network-based transportation capacity matching also help to reduce empty legs for carriers and wasted fuel. In addition, systems for dock appointment scheduling and yard management decrease dock congestion as well as time and fuel used by carriers waiting to have their trucks unloaded or loaded. Capabilities for real-time truck visibility also facilitate better loading and unloading of vehicles to reduce dwell time, idle time and fuel consumed at distribution centers.\n\nThe technology opportunities go well beyond individual organizations and supply chains to multi-party collaboration through pool distribution. By aggregating deliveries across multiple retailers to the same locations, such as malls and shopping complexes, transportation providers using pool distribution technologies improve delivery productivity; reduce delivery distance, number of vehicles needed and fuel consumed; and minimize empty miles due to inefficient matching of shipments to carriers. Additionally, digitizing transportation management processes, such as with electronic shipping documentation that replaces paper-based manifests, eliminates paper\u2014in many cases, one to five pages per delivery. If there is a perception that most sustainable transportation efforts result in less efficient supply chains, it needs to be corrected.\n\nIn fact, sustainable transportation programs are also an opportunity to capture more business. The home delivery sustainability study showed that consumers are more willing to buy from companies who can demonstrate that their supply chains are more sustainable and 60% want environmentally friendly delivery options. And, compared to the 2022 study, consumer expectations for sustainable delivery options are up significantly. Equally important for B2B companies is the opportunity to gain more business from companies that are looking at their supply chain partners to help reduce Scope 3 Emissions as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) initiated in January 2023. This standard requires more large businesses and SMEs that trade in the EU to conduct sustainability reporting to stricter standards from January 2024.\n\nWith growing consumer sentiment and increasing regulatory requirements on sustainability, companies need to look at sustainable transportation management as an opportunity to lower costs, make customers happier, grow the business and help the environment. How many chances are there to create such a win, win, win, win situation?"

This model hinges on the continuous extraction of raw materials to produce goods that, once reaching the end of their useful life, are discarded as waste.\n\nThe recycling economy attempts to mitigate this wastefulness by reusing materials; however, it often falls short of true sustainability, still producing considerable landfill waste and pollution.\n\nIn contrast, a circular economy seeks to redefine products and services to design waste out, aiming for a regenerative system that maintains the value of products, materials and resources for as long as possible.\n\nThe necessity for a circular approach becomes particularly evident in the context of the burgeoning demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), propelled by the clean energy transition and the global surge in electric vehicles (EVs). LIBs are at the heart of this shift, yet their production and end-of-life management encapsulate the challenges and opportunities of transitioning to a circular economy. The lead-acid battery recycling industry provides a stark lesson: despite achieving a high recycling rate, the reliance on smelting\u2014emitting vast amounts of pollutants\u2014exemplifies the inherent limitations of traditional recycling within a linear framework. Such practices, while recycling materials, perpetuate environmental harm, underlining the imperative for innovative solutions that align with circular economy principles.\n\nThe entrenched nature of these recycling practices, fortified by significant investments in existing technologies, poses a formidable barrier to adopting cleaner alternatives. This inertia is exacerbated by the absence of regulatory incentives to foster change, illustrating the complex interplay between technology, policy and market forces in advancing towards circularity. The transition to a circular battery economy necessitates not only technological innovation but also a paradigm shifts in regulatory and economic models to incentivize sustainable practices over established, polluting ones.\n\nThe journey toward a circular economy in the lithium-ion battery supply chain is fraught with challenges but is indispensable for achieving sustainability in the clean energy transition. By embracing circular economy principles and fostering technological and strategic collaborations, we can pave the way for a sustainable future where economic growth and environmental preservation are not mutually exclusive but mutually reinforcing. As we advance, it is incumbent upon us to champion such transformative approaches, ensuring that the lithium-ion battery supply chain exemplifies the principles of circularity, sustainability and resilience."

            "article_text": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nArt Figueroa is the SVP of global operations at Smith & Associates. Opinions are the author\u2019s own.\n\nThe chip sector underpins so much of our lives and is crucial to ongoing technological advancement from the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G to artificial intelligence, consumer electronics, healthcare, vehicles and beyond. The world as it currently exists cannot function without semiconductors, with a single smartphone having around 160 different chips and hybrid electric cars including up to 3,500.\n\nAs a result, semiconductor production has increased exponentially. In 2022, the global chip market totaled $574.1 billion compared to $335.2 billion in 2015, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe importance placed on both chips and sustainability today has caused many to turn an eye toward the semiconductor industry. Chip manufacturing is resource intensive and has a significant carbon footprint. It uses large amounts of water, consumes vast amounts of electricity and requires gases that can produce hazardous waste.\n\nSustainability in the chip industry is becoming critical. Greater effort has been exerted to find ways to minimize the environmental impacts of chip production as technology companies work toward loftier environmental, social and governance goals. It will be equally important for those who participate in the supply chain to implement changes to help alleviate the industry\u2019s environmental impact.\n\nTaking action by minimizing your carbon footprint\n\nIf your company is looking to become more sustainable, the first step is evaluation. When you have a global company, there are certain variables and factors that are out of your control. However, you can identify \u201clow-hanging fruit,\u201d or areas of the business where positive changes could most easily and inexpensively be made. These changes are an investment not only in our future but also in your company\u2019s brand and reputation.\n\nTo get started, it is helpful to establish benchmarking metrics to measure a company\u2019s sustainability progress. Start a companywide sustainability group with people from across departments to conduct an audit and find opportunities and priorities where you can make impacts in these areas.\n\nIdentifying any certifications in your industry that can motivate and guide improvements can further help you confirm your adherence. For example, the ISO 14001 standard helps companies and organizations by providing practical tools to manage their environmental responsibilities.\n\nPossible areas to implement \u201cgreener\u201d practices include:\n\nStreamlining packaging and eliminating excess waste.\n\nDecreasing your transportation footprint. This includes improving shipping efficiency by planning in advance to keep orders timely and prevent the need to express-ship products via air freight, which is very fuel intensive. Efforts to onshore chip manufacturing through the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act can also help decrease your carbon footprint from transportation.\n\nLowering electricity usage by installing solar panels or adding LED and motion-sensor office lighting.\n\nMinimizing water use where possible.\n\nEliminating the use and generation of hazardous chemicals.\n\nCurrent initiatives to improve sustainability in the chip supply chain\n\nMajor chipmakers are prioritizing sustainability as they plan construction on new fabs. Samsung, for example, has rolled out a new environmental strategy with plans to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and prioritize water conservation. Intel recently committed to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in its global operations by 2040, and is aiming to achieve 100% use of renewable electricity in 2030. Furthermore, OEMs, such as Apple, are putting pressure on suppliers to support their sustainability goals, including adhering to environmental policies and providing greater supply chain transparency.\n\nThe industry continues to make efforts toward better measuring and tracking carbon emissions throughout the chip supply chain. For example, Belgium-based semiconductor research accelerator Imec has formed the Sustainable Semiconductor Technologies and Systems research program to bring together stakeholders of the semiconductor value chain, including Microsoft. The program emphasizes sharing emissions data across the entire manufacturing lifecycle and across the supply chain, with the aim of using the combined knowledge and expertise to implement more sustainable solutions.\n\nThere is increasing pressure from stakeholders to incorporate environmental accountability into business models to achieve ESG goals as sustainability continues to be a vital issue. Greening the semiconductor supply chain is an ongoing challenge and process, but it is promising to see that companies are prioritizing greener practices and the beginnings of metrics standardization across the industry. In the long run, investing in sustainability is a high-return investment for everyone along the supply chain."

            "article_text": "Assent recently surveyed global complex manufacturers on ESG efforts across the supply chain and their study found that 76% of manufacturers are at the planning stages of supply chain ESG maturity and 69% plan to increase their supply chain ESG and sustainability investments in 2023. This study highlights that ESG, sustainability management and supply chain climate impacts are important for manufacturers. Results of this research showed that 55% of complex manufacturers cited climate impact as a current supply chain ESG priority at their organization. Yet only 31% are confident in the quality and accuracy of their data. This means that better data collection and supplier engagement will be top priorities for 2023. Especially as ESG impacts are under increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThis new research emphasizes that manufacturers are deeply aware of the critical need for credible supply chain ESG data to sustain business growth and meet stakeholder expectations,\u201d says Andrew Waitman, CEO of Assent. \u201cAt the same time, there is an urgent need to improve supply chain visibility to meet evolving ESG standards and requirements. There is a gap that needs to be addressed immediately as only 25% of complex manufacturers are highly confident that their suppliers have the capabilities today to credibly support their supply chain initiatives. Companies who are accelerating their ESG are in the lead as they will maintain market access, grow their business and deliver responsible products to the world.\"\n\nFrom Assent:"

            "article_text": "Editor's note: This story is part of a series marking Supply Chain Dive's five-year anniversary. Look back at some of the most important stories in supply chain since 2016 in this round-up.\n\nFedEx's globe-spanning air cargo network looks much different than it did five years ago. It has added dozens of aircraft to its fleet, expanded major shipping hubs and cut down on emissions \u2014 although it fell short of a goal set a few years earlier.\n\nIn 2011, FedEx sought to reduce aircraft emissions 30% by 2020, from a 2005 baseline. The cargo airline aimed to reach this target, revised from a 20% reduction goal announced in 2008, in part by replacing aging aircraft and using more sustainable fuels.\n\nBut as the decade progressed, FedEx's e-commerce volume ballooned. Older, less efficient aircraft stayed in service to keep pace with demand, the company said in its 2021 ESG report. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this trend, leading FedEx to fall short of its goal. The company ended up reducing its aircraft emissions 27% from 2005 levels.\n\nThe fuel burned by FedEx and other air cargo carriers' jets remains a substantial roadblock toward reaching their \u2014 and customers' \u2014 ambitious sustainability goals.\n\n\"Unlike other transport activities that can be powered by batteries or already have wide availability of low-carbon fuels, achieving 'true' sustainability in aviation is an intractable problem,\" said FedEx Chief Sustainability Officer Mitch Jackson in an email.\n\nFedEx is among many airlines that have made progress in reducing their energy intensity, but aviation remains a notable source of global emissions. Aviation produced 2.8% of global CO2 emissions in 2019, according to the International Energy Agency. And an Environmental and Energy Study Institute report said airfreight generated 19% of aviation's emissions the year before.\n\nAviation emissions will see slight decline by 2030 CO2 emissions by transport mode, in metric tons\n\nAviation \"is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise\" as it requires high-power output and energy-dense fuels, according to the IEA. The agency projects emissions from passenger and freight vehicles will see larger emissions declines by 2030 compared to aviation emissions.\n\nRoei Ganzarski, executive chairman of electric aircraft maker Eviation, said the technology for making large freighter aircraft like the Boeing 777 all-electric will be available, at the earliest, 30 years in the future.\n\n\"Even if we could create a propulsion system that was big enough, powerful enough, lightweight enough to go on that size aircraft, right now and in the foreseeable future there's no energy storage system that could even come close to competing with Jet A fuel,\" Ganzarski said.\n\nShippers want lower emissions, but need more airplanes\n\nCompanies are taking notice of aviation's emissions challenges as they lay out their own sustainability goals. L'Oreal found reducing its reliance on airfreight by shifting more volume to rail and sea would have an outsized impact on its supply chain emissions.\n\n\"I think what we'll see in the future is \u2026 airlines that make those changes to reduce those emissions faster than everybody else will be utilized more and will grow faster,\" said Greg Bollefer, executive vice president of commercial and product development at freight forwarder Green Worldwide Shipping.\n\nGlyn Hughes, director general of The International Air Cargo Association, agrees. He noted many shippers are now reporting how much their supply chains produce in emissions, and they're looking for carbon-neutral transportation options. In the long-term, TIACA supports manufacturers having \"a blended series of supply chains\" that use ocean shipping as well to reduce environmental impacts.\n\n\"Unlike other transport activities that can be powered by batteries or already have wide availability of low-carbon fuels, achieving 'true' sustainability in aviation is an intractable problem.\" Mitch Jackson FedEx Chief Sustainability Officer\n\n\"We would support that because we think it's much better to have a globally efficient economy that has the least environmental impact and the maximum benefit for society,\" Hughes said.\n\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of air transport in supply chains. Speed, not cost, was the priority as companies transported personal protective equipment from China to the U.S. for use by frontline health care workers. Air transport also plays a key role in e-commerce delivery, with online retail giant Amazon using its Air network to replenish its warehouses. Some companies have relied more on air transport this year to avoid a congested ocean freight environment.\n\nThose needs are helping overall air cargo demand grow, even if some companies are reducing their reliance on the transport mode. Seventy-two percent of airline CFOs and heads of cargo surveyed by the International Air Transport Association in July expected cargo demand would increase in a year, aided by growth in passenger flight activity. That's an improvement from the previous survey's result in April of 56%.\n\nAirfreight isn't exclusive to all-cargo carriers, with IATA estimating 50% of cargo volumes fly in the belly of passenger aircraft. Transporting passengers brings its own sustainability challenges: Passenger operations contributed to around 85% of the industry's emissions in 2019, while dedicated freighter and belly cargo operations each contributed around 7%, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation.\n\nSustainable aviation fuel has short supply, high cost\n\nLike FedEx, UPS has seen its demand spike during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to more flights. The majority of UPS' CO2 emissions (61.3%) come from airline fuel, and the amount emitted from its air fleet increased 12% from 2019 to 2020, according to its Global Reporting Initiative report. UPS aims to increase its use of sustainable aviation fuels, which it called \"the only decarbonization path for the aviation sector,\" to reduce emissions from its air fleet.\n\nSustainable aviation fuels, known in the industry as SAFs, use an alternative feedstock to crude oil, such as cooking oils, plant oils or municipal waste, according to the IATA. FedEx is eager to use more SAFs, Jackson said, \"but there's not nearly enough supply currently available. Plus, the limited supply that is available costs at least three times as much as conventional jet fuel.\"\n\nLike the all-cargo carriers, passenger airlines are keeping sustainability in mind by using newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft and exploring uses of SAFs, Airlines for America said earlier this year.\n\nJackson said the Sustainable Skies Act, which was introduced into Congress in May, would encourage additional SAF production via a tax credit for producers. House and Senate versions of the bill remain in their introductory phases.\n\nDHL Express ordered 12 electric planes from aircraft manufacturer Eviation, the logistics company announced Aug. 3. Courtesy of DHL Express\n\nThere's currently \"no choice\" to substantially reduce large aircraft emissions outside of SAFs, Ganzarski said. Smaller, feeder aircraft used in carriers' shorter flights, however, are already on the path to electrification. DHL Express announced in August it ordered 12 all-electric Alice aircraft from Eviation for regional routes in the U.S.\n\n\"It's really a complement to the current fleet, not a replacement of it currently, unless you're a small operator whose fleet happens to be Cessna Caravans, then yes, it's a replacement,\" Ganzarski said. \"But if you're talking about the major airlines, it's a complement.\"\n\nGanzarski said in the future, larger aircraft \u2014 \"maximum 100 seats\" and similar in size to the ATR 72 turboprop airliner \u2014 will be able to be supported by electric power. Additionally, flight ranges should improve as batteries do.\n\n\"If you look at how our cell phone batteries have evolved in the last few years, I think that the investment in different battery technology means that [electric aircraft] will start small and short distance,\" Hughes said. \"Probably within a 10-year timeframe, we're talking about significantly longer ranges with significantly larger payloads.\"\n\nWith aviation's fuel challenges not going away any time soon, Bollefer said LCL express services are popular for shippers looking to reduce the costs and emissions that come with air transport while still keeping transit times brisk.\n\nSourcing products closer to the end user is another way for companies to reduce their carbon footprints if their operations allow, he added.\n\n\"If something's sourced in China that can be sourced in Mexico for the same price, but you lower your overall CO2 emissions by 10,000 tons, that's a huge impact,\" Bollefer said.\n\nClarification: A previous version of this article did not include the full name of Green Worldwide Shipping."
