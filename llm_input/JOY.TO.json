            "article_text": "In May, IFS hosted a virtual roundtable on environment, social and governance (ESG) issues with manufacturer Nature\u2019s Path Foods. The panel focused on many facets of sustainability, including the need for industry transparency around best practices, the demand for sustainable-minded workers, the importance of data, and measuring the carbon impact of important technologies like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nGiles Peddy, managing director/EVP at SourceCode UK & Europe, a PR agency for IFS, served as the panel's moderator, and to start, he outlined some of the challenges facing sustainability in industry, as an introduction to the panel\u2019s discussion.\n\n\u201cFor businesses in North America, the pressure is on to focus on sustainability, especially as the U.S. government has recently invested in $6 billion in funding, aimed at advancing technology to help reduce emissions across otherwise hard to decarbonize sectors, including food, steel, and chemicals,\u201d Peddy said.\n\n\u201cBut how does this actually happen? How do organizations make that shift and how do they ensure they have all the data they need? This is what our panel will look to dive into this morning, as well as embedding sustainability into business strategy needs for the priorities of companies in 2024,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe following six key takeaways from the panel\u2019s sustainability discussion and speaker highlights to help outline where industry stands with sustainability and where it\u2019s going.\n\nMany organizations also struggle to take the first steps toward being more environmentally friendly. Maybe you aren\u2019t quite ready for action, but starting the conversations now will help reach those goals faster. How is your company thinking about sustainability? If you\u2019re not sure where to start, use these sustainability highlights to think about your own company. (And we\u2019ve provided some discussion questions inspired by the IFS panelists to get your plant started on the sustainability journey.)\n\n1. Sustainability is a wholistic business strategy, not an add-on program.\n\n\u201cEveryone is embedding sustainability in their business strategy. There's no standalone sustainability on the side,\u201d said Caitlin Keam, senior director of sustainability applications at IFS. \u201cWe know best practices in our industry, but that's changing, and we just want to learn from our peers. I really feel like that's how people are coming together and trying to bring more transparency around this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's not about having a huge team. It's about embedding it everywhere in your business. It's sustainability embedded,\u201d she added.\n\nStrategy discussion: How does our company think about sustainability wholistically? Do we have a sustainability program? How could we embed sustainability more into the overall business strategy?\n\n2. Sustainability needs the right talent and a connection between the environmental mission to everyday work.\n\n\u201cIf you're looking at retention, or even attracting top talent in North America, people are asking the right questions before. Actually, they want to know what else are you doing on top of certifications, on top of standards, on top of regulations?\u201d said Manuel Gorrin, director of mission & justice, equity, diversity and inclusion at Nature's Path Foods. \u201cEvery single team member and the company is part of the sustainability team. We don't even have a committee or green committee because we want the message to be alive in every single conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also need to make it very clear, too: How is that connected to their day to day work?\u201d Gorrin added. \u201cIt's not just about data, it's actually that whole piece of connecting what you're doing business strategy, and then you will need the data no matter what, but you also need to make it very easy. So it's part of the day to day any other job.\u201d\n\nWorkforce discussion: What does the type of talent we attract say about our view of sustainability? How do we help workers connect sustainability to their daily tasks and could we do more?\n\n3. Sustainability needs dedicated resource allocation, and it must also be affordable and reliable.\n\n\u201cIf sustainability is everyone\u2019s job, then it\u2019s no one\u2019s job\u2026if you don't get the governance, right, everything else will fail. The problem with sustainability is that it's everyone's job, which means it can be no one's job,\u201d said Sophie Graham, chief sustainability officer at IFS. \u201cThere's really a challenge in terms of making sure that the resource allocation is there across the business, and that really starts from the top from my perspective, so getting it top level support.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs consumer costs rise or power supply becomes constrained or not reliable, sustainability goals can often take a backseat,\u201d said Carol Johnston, vice president of energy, utilities & resources at IFS. \u201cYou add on top of that the ever-shifting winds in North America, political winds that haven't really helped this transition either.\u201d\n\nResource discussion: Whose job is sustainability at our business? What resources do we have allocated to sustainability? Does management support our sustainability efforts?\n\n4. Sustainability won\u2019t succeed without the right data reporting and modeling.\n\n\u201cGet your data into systems. Once it's in systems, we can work with it. We can have bring it into a central location\u2026.the next step, once the data is in, is ensuring data quality,\u201d said Keam.\n\n\u201cIt's not going to be enough to just report out a single data point. With a lot of the regulation that's coming in the EU, but also in the U.S., it's looking at things like climate risk reporting in different warming scenarios, and how your business fares under those different scenarios. So you have to do that forward looking modeling,\u201d said Graham.\n\nData discussion: Do we have a centrally located system? Can we ensure data quality? How is climate change likely to affect our business and what data do we need to model those outcomes?\n\n5. Technology has sustainability implications too.\n\n\u201cI'm just reflecting on the energy consumption, the usage around the growth of AI. And I'm also quite interested in it and watching it because it's twofold. It's that AI is going to bring a lot of efficiency, while using a lot of energy to do so,\u201d said Keam. \u201cI really think that the future is not thinking \u2018AI here\u2019 and \u2018sustainability here.\u2019 We're seeing sustainability and AI embedded as part of our future.\u201d\n\nTechnology discussion: How do we measure the efficiency of our equipment? How do we balance the efficiency gains from technologies like AI with their own power needs?\n\n6. Sustainability will take private and government investment.\n\n\u201cLooking forward now, so moving out of last year and into what's coming, we're seeing the energy and utility investments in sustainability initiatives set to increase dramatically\u2014refundable, renewable credits, tax credits for energy storage, and carbon capture credits,\u201d said Johnston.\n\nInvestment discussion: What government initiatives are available to help our business transition to a greener economy? What investment do we need to support sustainability initiatives?\n\nTrying to understand U.S. industrial policy, how the government is working with industry on sustainability issues and how that might affect your business? Learn more about government\u2019s role in industry led by Inflation Reduction Act investment, the status of scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions standards and reporting, and plans from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Transitions for billions of dollars in grants, cost shares, and loan guarantees here. DOE supports a government enabled, industry-led energy transition. Are you part of industry leading this transition?"

            "article_text": "While some might consider over 30 years with one company as career stagnation, nothing could be further from the truth for Olivier Blum.\n\nFor Olivier, who is approaching 32 years of employment at Schneider Electric, the longevity has been driven by varied roles across different geographies, strategic opportunities \u2013 and passion for the sustainability vision that is the beating heart of Schneider.\n\nFew global companies come close to matching this France-headquartered energy management and industrial automation company\u2019s sustainability focus and results. Today, Schneider has gained a reputation as The Most Sustainable Company in the World (TIME and Statista), thanks to its commitment to driving Electricity 4.0 (electrification and digitisation) and helping customers achieve their decarbonisation goals.\n\nBut as Olivier goes on to say, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C, there must be more action from governments and regulators to balance societal needs with environmental impact, especially with the development of Artificial Intelligence and other technological advancements.\n\nOlivier\u2019s Journey at Schneider Electric\n\nAs the company\u2019s EVP of Energy Management, Olivier has been involved at almost every step of Schneider\u2019s sustainability journey.\n\nHe has taken up a range of positions in the company all around the world, from sales and marketing to strategy and HR, and finally to his current role in Energy Management.\n\nHe says: \u201cI am fortunate to hold a unique position in the company, having gained diverse experience through various roles across different geographies.\n\n\u201cOur energy management business, which represents 79% of Schneider Electric\u2019s turnover, is where we gather the portfolio of activities that help our customers to go through their decarbonisation journey.\u201d\n\nOlivier adds: \u201cI've been engaged in the sustainability journey of Schneider since almost day one, 20 years ago, when we created our first strategy.\n\n\u201cI was working at that time for the chairman and CEO of Schneider as a chief of staff in charge of the first project.\u201d\n\nHe says the range of roles aided his understanding of sustainability, including when he was Chief HR Officer \u2013 which \u201chas given me another angle on ESG, more on the social side\u201d.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe fact that I had this combination of being in sales, marketing, product development, then at one point took over a smaller business unit globally, then HR, then chief strategy and sustainability \u2013 this combination of experience gives me a different view on my current role and the value of energy management to our customers, and of course to Schneider.\u201d\n\nThe excitement is sustainable\n\nWhen asked what excites him about the job, Olivier ties it in tightly to the company\u2019s commitment to sustainability and its ability to drive systemic change.\n\nHe says: \u201cWhy I've been in the company for 30 years is related to your question because this company has developed a unique positioning in the market.\n\n\u201cWe are very committed to being a sustainable company and very committed to all the pillars of ESG. But, since we are a digital partner for efficiency and sustainability, we are also committed to the solutions for our customers.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cWhen you step back and say: \u2018The company is investing one billion euros in R&D every year to develop the portfolio, the solutions and the technologies that will help the company to achieve its net zero goal and eventually have a positive impact at scale. That's quite exciting.\u201d\n\nOlivier is also invigorated every day by Schneider\u2019s international identity.\n\n\u201cSchneider has always been committed to being a truly international company with a very, very diverse pool of talent.\n\n\u201cAnd I love this opportunity to work with different people, different cultures, different backgrounds.\u201d\n\nSustainability as a service\n\nWhile many companies provide products, Schneider Electric takes it to the next level by working as an end-to-end partner with its customers, in order to \u2013 as Olivier explains \u2013 \u201chelp them to go through their decarbonisation journey, to achieve their energy and efficiency goals\u201d.\n\nHe adds: \u201cWe develop solutions to enable our partners in the world to decarbonise and they are important because, if you want to have an impact at scale, you need partnership everywhere. That's the mission of Schneider Electric.\n\n\u201cEverything we do is to try to help companies, to help our customers \u2013 large ones, medium ones, small ones \u2013 in all industries, in homes, buildings, data centres and infrastructure, to have access to energy, to optimise usage and to decarbonise their energy supply to eventually achieve their climate transition goals. This is crucial, considering the energy sector accounts for 80% of CO2 emissions.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201dWe do that everywhere in the world. We have 150,000 employees globally.\n\n\u201cWe also have more than a million partners operating in over 100 countries to ensure proximity to our customers and stakeholders.\u201d\n\nThe approach is clearly working. Only last month, Schneider Electric was placed 2nd in Sustainability Magazine\u2019s 250 Companies in Sustainability.\n\nIn recent years, it was selected by Corporate Knights as the most sustainable company in the world and by Time as one of the world\u2019s most sustainable companies.\n\nOlivier says: \u201cThis is good because, while I'm convinced about it, it's even better when external organisations recognise and endorse that our sustainability strategy has a positive impact.\u201d\n\nMaintaining the momentum\n\n\u201cOur passion is always to understand what it will take for a company to achieve their net zero goals.\u201d\n\nThat passion, says Olivier, drives the desire to continually reach the next level of sustainability.\n\nHe says that it requires the latest technology, consulting, services and digital systems, adding that Schneider aims to utilise these in every sector.\n\n\u201cThe combination depends on whether you are dealing with a CEO of a large company or a consumer.\u201d\n\nExamples include:\n\nTake MasterPacT, an industry leader for 35 years. Recently, we launched the Circular MTZ, where we collect, check and re-certify breakers for reuse. Additionally, we introduced the latest generation of MTZ Active breakers, enabling data centres and other energy-intensive industries to manage energy solutions and consumption, ensuring optimal operations. Zeigo Activate, a cloud-based subscription software targeted towards small and medium enterprises. Scope 3 emissions are becoming a bigger focus, and with regulation like CSRD coming into effect, SMEs are under more pressure to decarbonise, Zeigo Activate is designed to help them meet their decarbonisation goals.\n\nAchieving the balance between sustainability and impact\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in rules, regulations and legislation around environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting \u2013 making it more difficult for companies to dodge their net zero responsibilities.\n\nFor Olivier, it is unquestionably a good thing. But he says there is a difficult balance to achieve for companies like Schneider, which seek to be sustainable while having an impact.\n\nHe says: \u201cWhen you standardise ESG reporting, it's good because you put a minimum expectation on everyone, but the big risk is that it becomes a compliance exercise.\n\n\u201cWhat I've learned is that becoming a sustainable company is about how the future will look and what you can do to impact the world.\n\n\u201cBeing a sustainable company and an impact company is not about compliance, it's about finding the solution for tomorrow.\u201d\n\nLooking forward to COP29\n\nSchneider endeavours to put itself at the centre of discussions and solutions to the global climate crisis.\n\nWith COP29 coming up in Baku, Azerbaijan, how would Olivier like to see it build on COP28?\n\nHe says: \u201cGovernments should continue making the same commitments they made at COP28 on the transition from fossil fuels to renewables.\n\n\u201cI'm not a dreamer, it cannot happen overnight. But I think making a very strong commitment every year is most important.\u201d\n\nHis second hope is that governments will make a stronger commitment to tackling the demand side of energy.\n\n\u201cSupply is extremely important, but demand is 50% of the answer and there is always a much smaller focus on the demand side than the supply side.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cHow are governments going to put in incentives for people in their homes and for companies in their office buildings, to make stronger commitments on energy efficiency and decarbonisation?\u201d\n\nFinally, Olivier wants more action on decarbonisation of existing buildings, saying: \u201cWhen you look at CO2 emission, 80% is from energy and the highest energy demand comes from the building sector.\n\n\u201cWhile constructing green buildings is paramount for our future, the real challenge for the near term \u2013 10, 15 years \u2013 is retrofitting the existing stock of homes and buildings to make those more efficient and sustainable. 50% of buildings that will exist in 2050 already exist today. That's where we need government help and incentives.\"\n\nThe future is digital and electric\n\nSchneider has a long-proven ability to adapt to challenges and to present new solutions to its customers.\n\nThis puts it in a strong position to face two of the greatest obstacles on the path to net zero \u2013 artificial intelligence and data centres.\n\nBoth have a huge and growing appetite for energy.\n\nSchneider works with its customers to provide the energy management systems and solutions to help reduce data centre emissions.\n\nThe company is strongly committed to helping its customers decarbonise, and embeds these principles in its research & development processes to systemically reduce the environmental impact of its products and to help customers more efficiently manage their operations and transition to lower carbon sources of energy.\n\nSchneider also has its Sustainability Research Institute, created five years ago, and its advisory division, the Sustainability Business, a leading global consultancy on energy management and decarbonisation.\n\nOlivier says: \u201cWe have developed very specific competencies in consulting on decarbonisation and the energy transition. And our contribution through our research institute is to provide technical white papers on different decarbonisation and sustainable scenarios.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to take the big challenges and make their solutions more actionable, more practical. What does it take to decarbonise data centres, for instance?\n\nHe adds: \u201cWe have a big consulting and research institute project to bring a white paper to show to the people at COP29 that the technology is available today.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to AI, he says: \u201cWe know with the evolution of AI, those data centres\u2019 appetite for energy will get bigger and bigger. What will be the technologies that will make it happen without emissions also getting bigger and bigger?\u201d\n\nHe continues to explain that artificial intelligence can be an accelerator for the energy transition. It can help reduce carbon emissions with efficient use of energy and optimizing energy demand. AI models can create predictive energy consumption models, enhancing the efficiency of processes like HVAC systems and district heating. By managing energy storage and shifting consumption times, AI could reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nIt is in the DNA of Schneider Electric to come up with solutions, not problems. And Olivier is certain that digital is a big part of the solution.\n\nHe says: \u201cI think digital is a huge accelerator of decarbonisation. At Schneider, we always say: \u2018Being sustainable is a combination of being more electrical and more digital, this is what we also call Electricity 4.0\u2019.\n\n\u201cThat story has been true for many years. But the fact that digital has accelerated and AI is helping us to make it simpler for our clients to receive recommendations, I do believe it's a game changer.\u201d\n\nLooking forward to the coming 18 months, Olivier is \u201coptimistic\u201d.\n\nHe says: \u201cI believe the next 12-18 months is going to be a very interesting period.\n\n\u201cAll the large companies and governments which have made net zero commitments will start to realise that if they want to get to their net zero commitment by 2050 \u2013 and therefore the first milestone, which is 2030 \u2013 they'll have to go twice as fast in everything they do.\u201d"

One of their primary obstacles is reducing CO2 emissions while continuing to grow, with a goal of cutting emissions from their data centers by 42% by 2030. Additionally, they aim to source 40% of their energy from self-generated green sources across all LCL data enters by 2030.\n\nLCL\u2019s remarkable transformation started with a foundational materiality assessment to identify key priorities, followed by the adoption of an ESG framework. This created a comprehensive ESG roadmap, paving the way for their first ESG report in June 2022. As the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) came into force in 2024, LCL deepened their transformation journey, intensifying efforts to embed sustainability across all aspects of their operations. A pivotal step was the double materiality assessment, which redefined 14 key sustainability themes material to the company. Building on this, they released a more robust second sustainability report, showcasing significant improvements in transparency and reporting depth. Through a comprehensive CSRD gap analysis, LCL aligned their policies, actions, and targets with the Directive\u2019s requirements, marking a transformative shift toward more comprehensive and accountable ESG practices that position the company for long-term impact."

            "article_text": "Effectively the world is living off major investment decisions in oil and gas that were made before the oil price fall in 2015. If nothing changes, hydrocarbons markets could tighten even more, triggering even higher-than-expected price hikes.\n\n\n\nInvestors have been deterred from the energy sector for two reasons. First, perceived ESG concerns may lead to further derating. In fact, deteriorating support for the sector has pushed oil stocks to extremely low valuations with a price/free cashflow ratio near 25-year lows (Display, below). Second, a collapse in demand for hydrocarbons may leave unused reserves \u201cstranded\u201d and effectively worthless.\n\n\n\nIn our view, stranded asset fears are misplaced. We think energy stock prices are predominantly valued on a discounted cash flow analysis based on existing projects; that means no value is placed on fields that aren\u2019t yet producing or will produce soon. Most oil and gas companies have about a 10-year reserve life\u2014a period in which fossil fuels will be critical for a smooth energy transition and short enough for investors in select oil and gas stocks to receive satisfactory returns. And if investor aversion continues to act as an additional brake on investment, energy prices will remain high, buoying cash returns to shareholders.\n\nBalancing Environmental and Social Concerns\n\nFor ESG-focused investors, the backlash against big energy is understandable given the environmental damage of fossil fuels. However, because of the dynamics of the transition to renewables, we think there is a social dimension to consider as well.\n\n\n\nA chronic energy deficit will hit poor countries and poor people hardest. For instance, if lack of power disrupts irrigation in poor countries, water and food will be in short supply. In developed countries, poorer people could be forced to choose between food and heating their homes in winter as prices spike.\n\n\n\nPolicymakers will find it challenging to maintain the consensus for energy transition if people suffer and businesses shut down because of higher energy costs. How long can they ride out a backlash from voters? As the IEA comments:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe wholesale transformation of the energy sector cannot be achieved without the active and willing participation of citizens. It is ultimately people who drive demand for energy-related goods and services, and societal norms and personal choices will play a pivotal role in steering the energy system onto a sustainable path\u201d\n\nWider Perspective Presents Practical Solutions\n\nFaced with this complex picture, governments and investors need to take a more nuanced view of ESG issues to help enable a credible transition journey to net zero. If the journey is fraught with adverse near-term outcomes for society, it will be hard to reach the destination on time.\n\n\n\nCurrently, some major oil and gas companies are redeploying their hydrocarbon cash flows to invest in and develop renewable businesses, including associated infrastructure such as electric vehicle charging points on fuel station forecourts. And switching from dirtier hydrocarbons such as coal to cleaner ones like natural gas is also an important interim step on the journey.\n\n\n\nConsequently, we think that oil and gas companies with credible energy transition strategies are actually part of the solution and deserve closer attention from investors. Not only that, as these companies progress their corporate transformation plans, they will unlock value in next generation businesses in renewables and charging stations. The hydrocarbons industry has developed wide-ranging expertise in some of the critical areas for the energy transition. Logically, this makes select oil and gas stocks natural partners for governments and other stakeholders (Display, below)."

That\u2019s the highest rating in the EPA\u2019s Large Car category. It\u2019s also the second-highest rating of any 2024 model-year vehicle as of this writing.\u00b3\n\nThrough our focus on efficiency, variants of the Lucid Air have been able to achieve the longest range (up to 500 miles on a single charge\u2074) and one of the fastest-charging EVs (up to 20 miles added per minute\u2075) at the highest efficiency measured in miles/kilowatt-hour (4.74 miles per kilowatt hour).\n\nOur commitment to efficiency also shapes our battery philosophy. We use less batteries and battery materials to maintain the safety, quality, and driving experience Lucid\u2019s customers expect. In contrast to prevailing trends in the market \u2013 where bigger vehicles are often equipped with larger battery packs to achieve even a fraction of Lucid Air\u2019s range \u2013 our focus on efficiency allows us to reach impressive range with a smaller battery pack.\n\nSocial Responsibility, Community Impact and Human Rights\n\nAs an EV company, Lucid naturally has a strong environmental focus. But we believe sustainability and social responsibility extend far beyond our work towards a lower emissions future.\n\nWe are building a robust talent development program to support and encourage growth of our workforce, and we place an emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) across our global locations through trainings and initiatives like our employee resource groups (ERGs).\n\nWe seek the best and the brightest talent from around the globe who are committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible to create our innovative technology. I am grateful for the commitment and energy of every one of our team members; their hard work and dedication is what drives Lucid forward. \u2014 Peter Rawlinson, CEO & CTO, Lucid Group\n\nWe are committed to giving back to our local communities, through various events, fundraising drives and volunteer opportunities that promote STEAM and DEI efforts. We are a proud partner of the United Way of Pinal County in Arizona, supporting programs like GED scholarships, rental and utility assistance, and childcare assistance, having raised over $130,000 in 2022 for this important cause.\n\nAnd we are committed to protecting human rights, working to identify, prevent, mitigate and remedy adverse human rights impacts throughout our operations and broader value chain, including those of our suppliers and business partners. Aligned with these efforts, we have begun to build a robust human rights program to address potential human rights risks in our operations, an initiative that spans across all aspects of our business operations globally.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nLucid Group has the technical leadership, groundbreaking design, and pioneering spirit to create inspiring products with lower environmental impact.\n\nWe believe that being truly sustainable means never settling when it comes to our environmental and social impact and we are in the early stages of building a holistic approach in this area. As a relatively young company, Lucid is working on data collection and establishing our baseline on key focus areas for sustainability.\n\nMake no mistake, this is just the beginning for us, and we endeavor to improve our impact on the planet and society in the months and years to come. \u2014 Peter Rawlinson, CEO & CTO, Lucid Group\n\nWe believe in the importance of accountability and transparency, which is why we\u2019re creating this inaugural report. We intend it to provide a qualitative description of our products and programs \u2013 and we\u2019ll work to enhance our commitments, data, and reporting for future years.\n\nThis is just the beginning for Lucid.

            "article_text": "Meli\u00e1 Hotels International continues to refine its approach to sustainability while setting examples for the rest of the hotel industry.\n\nFor more than a decade, the Spanish hotel firm has been a pioneer in implementing measures to reduce its energy consumption and carbon emissions by integrating energy efficiency into its business model. Now the company is seeking carbon neutrality by 2050, along with major emissions reductions over the next decade.\n\n\u201cWe have been doing this for many years,\u201d said Lourdes Ripoll, Meli\u00e1\u2019s vice president of sustainability. \u201cI think that there were very few companies in 2014 that undertook this integration of the business model.\u201d\n\nA lot of Meli\u00e1\u2019s success is owed to technology and harnessing it to environmental, social and governance targets, Ripoll said.\n\nLourdes Ripoll is the vice president of sustainability at Meli\u00e1 Hotels International. (Meli\u00e1 Hotels International)\n\n\u201cWe have had our own environmental department focused on energy and water efficiency and monitoring and controlling that. Now we\u2019re taking that a step further toward a decarbonization of the business model,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added the group has systems for actively tracking and observing electricity and water consumption.\n\n\u201cAlready, in 2007, we had a proprietary environmental management system designed to enhance energy and water efficiency at our hotels. Since it was launched, [this system] SAVE has allowed the group to significantly reduce consumption,\" she said. \u201cWe know at all times in which cities or hotels we have water stress, and we constantly monitor the energy part of our hotels. Currently, more than 80% of our portfolio uses green energy.\"\n\nShe said that as these long-term climate commitments bear fruit, the sustainability accolades have rolled in.\n\nLast year, market intelligence group S&P Global hailed Meli\u00e1 as the most sustainable hotel group in Europe with an ESG score of 73. Two years earlier, it voted the company as the most sustainable hotel group in the world. Meli\u00e1 also appeared on Time\u2019s list of the \u201cWorld's Most Sustainable Companies of 2024,\u201d winning in the tourism category.\n\nBoth rankings take into account Meli\u00e1\u2019s certification and a detailed assessment of its performance on ESG risk management.\n\nThe group says more than half of its 400 hotels worldwide have certification from Madrid-based Ecostars. Ecostars' scheme rates hotels by the environmental impact per stay and is recognized by the World Tourism Organization and Global Sustainable Tourism Council, though not by the European Union.\n\nRipoll said 215 of its hotels are certified, with a goal to achieve more.\n\n\"We are committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, with a goal to reduce 71% of our emissions by 2035,\" she said.\n\nThe start of a trend\n\nRipoll said other hotel firms have taken notice of Meli\u00e1 efficiency measures and it is no longer a lone pioneer.\n\nMany independent and branded hotels are seeking net zero carbon emissions as the gold standard.\n\nIHG Hotels & Resorts\u2019 target is for all new-build hotels \u201cto operate at very low/zero carbon emissions by 2030.\u201d\n\nAustralian group Pro-Invest, which has a growing presence in Europe, has a 2030 net-zero target for its Asia-Pacific hotels. Accor brand M\u00f6venpick claims to be \"the world's most Green Globe-certified hotel group\" with 75% of properties having gold or platinum status.\n\n\"I think Meli\u00e1 is doing a lot of good things but not necessarily anything unique that others aren\u2019t doing,\u201d said Steve Newman, a sustainability consultant to the hospitality industry, who previously spent nine years in sustainability roles at Banyan Tree Hotels & Resorts.\n\n\u201cMelia has declared a near-term target, and they have a Scope 3 target,\" he said. Scope 3 focuses on reducing indirect greenhouse gas emissions that occur throughout the value chain.\n\nNewman explained that emissions offsets, which Meli\u00e1 and other companies do, are counted for \"residual, hard-to-eliminate emissions,\" but are not counted toward net-zero goals.\n\nNet zero can be achieved when a company completely offsets its total emissions across all scopes: Scope 3 described above; Scope 2, which includes indirect emissions from purchased energy; and Scope 1, which includes direct emissions through operations.\n\nAs it moves toward net zero, Meli\u00e1 has reported it is working on reducing emissions across the board, with targets of 51% cuts in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035, and 21% cuts in Scope 3 emissions.\n\nA \u201ckey criterion\u201d in the S&P rankings is a company\u2019s carbon disclosure project, or CDP, scores, Newman said.\n\n\u201cThe methodology is sound but limited in scope. Still, it\u2019s an indicator of those who are going through some strict and regulated review. I think there are many other companies that disclose their ESG performance to national exchanges, following strict governance, that were not considered in the scoring because they aren\u2019t registered with CDP or the Science Based Targets Initiative,\u201d Newman added.\n\nMeli\u00e1\u2019s sustainability efforts have also been certified by Green Globe and EarthCheck, measuring key sustainability metrics such as carbon emissions, energy usage and social impact.\n\nResorts, not last resorts\n\nFrancisco Benedito, CEO of Miami-based carbon-credit marketplace ClimateTrade, said \u201cMeli\u00e1 distinguishes itself by integrating sustainability initiatives deeply into its business strategy. \u2026 The strategic investments in sustainability have led to long-term financial gains.\u201d\n\nHoteliers increasingly see carbon offsetting and carbon credits as useful tools but ones that should be deemed as last resorts.\n\narticle 6 Min Read Hotel owners in Europe feel push to prioritize sustainability As European lawmakers pass more regulations on climate policy, hotel owners say ESG initiatives are part of their asset strategy to see a return on investment when the time comes to sell. Terence Baker Social\n\nMeli\u00e1 offsets its emissions through ClimateTrade \u201cas a complement, not a substitute,\u201d Benedito said.\n\n\u201cFor Meli\u00e1, carbon offsetting is part of a broader strategy that includes real emissions reductions. They focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable practices and certification before offsetting residual emissions,\" he said.\n\nHe also said the Spanish firm has been a leader \u201cwith its early adoption of green technologies.\u201d\n\nMeli\u00e1 now is focusing on pursuing a decarbonization strategy across all operations, harnessing artificial intelligence to improve energy efficiency, reducing its carbon footprint and transitioning to a low-carbon economy, Ripoll said. For example, \u201creducing [carbon dioxide] emissions by optimizing energy consumption in air conditioning using AI.\u201d\n\nMeli\u00e1 was founded in Spain\u2019s Balearic Islands. Its hotel there, Menorca\u2019s 159-room Villa Le Blanc Gran Meli\u00e1, is one Ripoll calls \u201csomething of a prototype \u2026 [a hotel] to lead the transition toward net-zero emission hotels.\u201d\n\nWaste management remains one of the biggest challenges, which the group is working on, she said. One example is a project in Mallorca that promotes the recycling of organic waste into compost for the local agricultural sector, which is then repurchased by the hotels to reintroduce into their supply chain.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that makes Meli\u00e1 stand out, Benedito said.\n\n\u201cMeli\u00e1\u2019s proactive measures and transparency set a benchmark. \u2026 It reports its environmental impacts comprehensively, fostering trust and accountability,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Meli\u00e1 may be a frontrunner, it is no longer alone.\n\nAnother Spanish group, Ilunion Hotels, is developing a decarbonization strategy for its 31 hotels focusing on renewable energies and energy efficiency measures.\n\nAll of its properties have Ecostars certification and most have BREEAM certification.\n\nSustainability underpins its strategic management plan, said Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Preciados Fernandez, CEO of Ilunion Hotels.\n\n\u201cCompanies without a sustainable approach will be left standing on the sideline,\" he said.\n\nElena Mart\u00edn Cuesta, the group\u2019s director of sustainability, said, \u201cwe want to be recognized as the best organization within the hotel sector and provide a benchmark in sustainability.\"\n\nMeli\u00e1 also is now focusing on sustainability in design and construction as it makes decarbonizing hotels. Some of its newer or retrofitted properties have achieved LEED certification for sustainable building practices.\n\nNot all hotels can afford to take such steps on sustainability, said Benedito.\n\n\u201cMany hotels face barriers like high upfront costs for retrofits, lack of expertise in sustainability or insufficient regulatory incentives,\u201d he added.\n\nRead more news on Hotel News Now."

            "article_text": "The recent high-level Central Economic Work Conference in Beijing laid out a comprehensive and ambitious workplan for China. One of the agreed-upon focus areas is to continue to \u201ccut carbon emissions, reduce pollution, pursue green development and boost economic growth in a concerted manner, and ramp up the green transition in economic and social development\u201d.[1] In an opinion piece for Caixin Global, UNEP FI co-authors Peiyuan Guo and Shouqing Zhu review China\u2019s progress on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure in 2024, and point out policy directions and priorities for 2025. Here, they summarize their analysis and discuss how UNEP FI can support members in aligning with China\u2019s disclosure policies while working with the government on the green transition.\n\nESG disclosure policy instruments lay groundwork for national disclosure system\n\nThe year of 2024 is sometimes dubbed in China as the \u201cYear for Disclosure\u201d, because several government policy instruments simultaneously set the country on a path for increased mandatory and voluntary sustainability information disclosure.\n\nIn February 2024, under the auspices of China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), China\u2019s three stock exchanges issued ESG reporting guidelines, mandating companies of the SSE 180 Index, STAR 50 Index, SZSE 100 Index, and ChiNext Index, and companies listed domestically and overseas to disclose their ESG data in 2026. CSRC also encourages other companies to publish ESG reports on a voluntary basis.\n\nAfter a public consultation process, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) finalized the Basic Guidelines for Corporate Sustainability Disclosure in December 2024, putting forward general requirements for sustainability information disclosure by Chinese enterprises. In general, it follows the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\u2019s disclosure framework, which requires companies to disclose information related to governance, strategy, risk and opportunity management, as well as indicators and targets. Unlike the ISSB Standard, which primarily takes a financial materiality perspective, MOF\u2019s guidelines follow the principle of double materiality, which assesses ESG impacts on a firm\u2019s financials as well as on ESG outcomes. The release of these guidelines is viewed as an important step in the development of a disclosure culture in China, because it marks the beginning of MOF\u2019s plan to issue both the general standard for corporate sustainability disclosure (based on IFRS S1) and the climate-related disclosure standard (based on IFRS S2) by 2027, laying the foundation for building a national sustainability disclosure system by 2030.\n\nGreen finance further leveraged for green transition\n\nIn 2020 China announced its goal to reach carbon peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, and subsequently released a plethora of policies to set the economy towards that goal, including emphasizing green finance to achieve and accelerate the green transition. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) and several other ministries issued policy instruments to encourage further development of green finance, including the \u201cGuiding Opinions on Further Strengthening Financial Support for Green and Low-Carbon Development\u201d and the \u201cOpinions on the Role of Green Finance to Serve the Construction of a Beautiful China\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cGuiding Opinions\u201d document, which was released by PBOC in conjunction with six other ministries in March 2024, calls for the full development of financial infrastructure, policies and standards, risk management practices, products and markets, and information disclosure. According to data from PBOC, China\u2019s green loans and green bonds both grew at an average rate of over 20% in the past seven years since its initial guidance for establishing the green financial system in 2016, which has boosted China\u2019s rise in areas of solar, wind, electric vehicles, batteries and other sectors. This new guidance aims to accelerate China\u2019s momentum to become the world\u2019s leader in all aspects of sustainable finance over the next five to ten years.\n\n\u201cFive Key Pillars\u201d gaining momentum\n\nChina has focused on poverty reduction and rural revitalization over the past decade. As the median age in China has rapidly increased, pensions also receive significant attention. With the 4th industrial revolution gaining momentum, technological and digital finance is becoming a high priority as well.\n\nIn October 2023, a concept called the \u201cFive Key Pillars\u201d of a modern financial system emerged from China\u2019s high-level Central Financial Work Conference. This new concept is commonly called \u201cFive Major Articles\u201d (\u4e94\u7bc7\u5927\u6587\u7ae0) in Chinese and it refers to technology finance, green finance, inclusive finance, pension finance, and digital finance. In July 2024, the Central Committee of the Communist Party adopted an important decision on \u201cFurther Deepening Reform Comprehensively to Advance Chinese Modernization\u201d, which directs financial institutions to explore innovative ways to finance projects in those five areas. In response to these calls, financial regulators and financial institutions accelerated their work. For example, the National Financial Regulation Administration (NFRA) urged banks and insurance companies to align their efforts with these areas by issuing the \u201cGuiding Opinions on the Banking and Insurance Industry to Deliver on the Five Key Pillars\u201d.\n\nHow can UNEP FI help?\n\nAs global frameworks to facilitate accelerated action on the goals set by the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals, the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) and Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) are well aligned to support\n\nLooking ahead, focus in China will stay with sustainability disclosure and financing the net zero transition. Although only indexed companies are required to make mandatory disclosures in 2026, it is expected that more leading companies will already begin to practice in 2025. Financial institutions that want to acquire a competitive edge will have to set targets on portfolio decarbonization and develop implementation plans. The guidance and tools that UNEP FI has developed can help PRB and PSI signatory members achieve their goals.\n\nA similar program is being developed by UNEP FI to support implementation of MOF\u2019s disclosure standards and PBOC\u2019s green finance agenda, which is a key step in accelerating China\u2019s green transition.\n\nFor more on how to stay abreast of regulatory developments and implementation support in China and Asia Pacific, Shouqing Zhu and Laura Canas Da Costa.\n\n[1] http://en.cppcc.gov.cn/2024-12/17/c_1053628.htm."
