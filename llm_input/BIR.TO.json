            "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: Dwindling supplies of coal in China have led to power rationing.LONG WEI/Getty Images\n\nRenewable energy is a growing sector that sits well with investors who want to align their portfolios with environmental solutions to global warming. But have you seen what coal has been doing?\n\nWelcome to one of the great conundrums in today\u2019s market.\n\nFunds that conform to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles are seeing a massive influx of investor dollars. Yet companies involved with fossil fuel extraction are being rewarded with spectacular gains this year, as demand for traditional energy surges against a backdrop of tight supplies that could last for months.\n\nChina\u2019s energy crunch triggers shutdowns, pleas for more coal\n\n\u201cThe winter heating season still hasn\u2019t started, but this turn of events is already lifting inflation and adding downside risks to economic growth across Europe and Asia,\u201d Omar Abdelrahman, an economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a note this week.\n\nCoal, a notoriously dirty fuel that is being phased out in much of Europe and North America as countries attempt to curb their carbon emissions, is enjoying a particularly strong resurgence amid strong demand in China, where dwindling supplies have led to power rationing.\n\nThe price of Australian Newcastle thermal coal, a global benchmark, has soared close to 200 per cent this year. That\u2019s underpinning a rally in the share prices of companies that have a close association with the commodity.\n\nArch Resources Inc. , the St. Louis-based coal producer, has seen its share price rise 120 per cent this year. Switzerland-based Glencore PLC\n\n, a diversified commodities powerhouse that is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of coal, is up 54 per cent. And Vancouver-based Teck Resources Ltd. , whose steelmaking coal business drives more than 40 per cent of the company\u2019s revenue, is up 41 per cent.\n\nCoal, whether thermal or metallurgical, is not alone among fossil fuels here.\n\nCrude oil is trading close to multiyear highs. British and Dutch natural gas prices soared as much as 500 per cent this year, before the rally lost some steam on Wednesday when Russia \u2013 a major gas exporter \u2013 said it was prepared to stabilize the market.\n\nAs a result, traditional commodity producers are now hot properties. Energy companies and miners are among the top performers within the S&P/TSX Composite Index this year. Birchcliff Energy Ltd. , for example, is up more than 270 per cent.\n\nThe part that may sting environmentally conscious investors? The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, an exchange-traded fund that also serves as a decent proxy for companies involved in wind and solar energy production, is down almost 24 per cent over the same period.\n\nThat raises the question of whether coal and other fossil fuels could regain favour among investors looking for strong returns. At the very least, investors may recognize that the transition toward renewable energy might not be smooth.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that is a consistent aspect of commodities is that they go up and down. And this is just another part of that cycle,\u201d said Jamie Bonham, director of corporate engagement at NEI Investments, a Toronto-based asset manager that focuses on responsible investing.\n\nIn the longer term, he believes, the gains made by coal and other fossil fuels this year are nearly irrelevant next to a complex energy transition that will take time to complete.\n\n\u201cAnyone who is making net-zero commitments, as investors are increasingly doing, has to think beyond where prices are going right now because of a certain demand crunch. It\u2019s a distraction, but it shouldn\u2019t affect where we\u2019re going,\u201d Mr. Bonham said in an interview.\n\nHe added: \u201cWho, based on this rise in prices, is going to build a new coal-fired plant in North America? Absolutely no one.\u201d\n\nStill, the case for environmentally sound investments looks a lot more compelling when stocks associated with wind and solar power generation are performing well, and fossil fuels are struggling. With coal now gleaming, you have to wonder whether some dollars once destined for ESG portfolios might land somewhere else.\n\nBe smart with your money.

            "article_text": "A group of Canada\u2019s largest natural gas producers including Tourmaline Oil Corp. and Ovintiv Inc. is pushing forward with a gas-export project called Ksi Lisims LNG and has filed for environmental approval for the 12 million-metric-ton-a-year facility on the West Coast.\n\nThe facility would be located near British Columbia\u2019s border with Alaska and would prepare super-chilled gas for export by tanker to markets in Asia, according to the application filed with the coastal province\u2019s government. The project is backed by the indigenous Nisga\u2019a Nation, Houston-based Western LNG and Rockies LNG Partners, which includes nine Canadian gas producers, including Tourmaline, Birchcliff Energy Ltd. and Paramount Resources Ltd.\n\nThe Rockies group, which accounts for a third of Canada\u2019s natural gas output, began work on the project after other liquefied natural gas proposals in the region were scrapped, including the Pacific NorthWest LNG project near Prince Rupert, led by Malaysia\u2019s Petroliam Nasional Bhd. Frustrated by delays to accessing overseas markets, some Canadian gas producers have also started shipping their gas from Western Canada all the way to LNG facilities on the US Gulf Coast.\n\n\u201cThese are large projects, and it takes a lot of shoulders behind it to get it to the finish line,\u201d Rockies LNG President Charlotte Raggett said of the effort for multiple producers to work together. Rockies LNG has offices inside Birchcliff Energy\u2019s headquarters in Calgary.\n\nKsi Lisims now joins a handful of other LNG projects at various stages of development in British Columbia, with demand for the fuel surging as nations seek to replace Russian pipeline gas supplies after its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Shell Plc-backed LNG Canada project, which would produce 14 million metric tons a year, is under construction and scheduled for completion by mid decade. Work has moved ahead on Woodfibre LNG, a project backed by Indonesian tycoon Sukanto Tanoto, and Pembina Pipeline Corp.\u2019s proposed Cedar LNG received a key environmental permit earlier this year.\n\n\n\nShare This:\n\nMore News Articles"

            "search_summary": "Shaping the Future For Sustainability Disclosure In Canada: Comment Period Open Until June 10\u00a0\u00a0BOE Report",
            "article_text": "The Canadian corporate responsibility and sustainability landscape is undergoing significant transformation with the introduction of the Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB) and its Exposure Drafts for the Canadian Sustainability Disclosure Standards (CSDS). These drafts are based on the International Financial Reporting Standards\u2019 (IFRS) Sustainability Standards, released in 2023, so it\u2019s likely that companies will not be very surprised by their contents. Stakeholders, however, still have until June 10, 2024, to review them and submit their comments. As this deadline approaches, energy companies should understand these new disclosure requirements to provide informed feedback that reflects their industry\u2019s realities.\n\nCurrently voluntary, these standards may become mandatory, especially as Canada seeks to compete in a global marketplace in which some foreign jurisdictions already face mandatory reporting. Additionally, stakeholders\u2014customers, suppliers, investors, and regulators\u2014increasingly demand sustainability reporting as a criterion for business relationships.\n\nThe CSSB aims to enhance the quality and comparability of sustainability-related disclosures among Canadian companies. It focuses on standardizing reporting to provide reliable information for assessing companies\u2019 environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance.\n\nThe CSSB\u2019s Exposure Drafts outline frameworks for reporting sustainability-related financial information, with a focus on:\n\nCSDS 1: General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information \u2013 Guides reporting companies to disclose sustainability risks and opportunities that impact investment decisions, aiming for comprehensive, comparable, and verifiable sustainability performance. CSDS 2: Climate-related Disclosures \u2013 Focuses on reporting greenhouse gas emissions, climate risks, and mitigation strategies, reflecting investor and regulatory pressure to address climate change.\n\nEnergy companies in Canada face several challenges and opportunities as they prepare for the June 10, 2024 deadline to respond. Key considerations include:\n\nAssessing Reporting Obligations \u2013 Companies should identify relevant metrics and indicators, conduct thorough assessments of their environmental and social impacts, and engage with stakeholders and Rightsholders to determine their reporting goals and objectives. With this understanding, companies will need to consider whether the CSDS allows enough time after the release of financial statements for them to be able to prepare and release their sustainability disclosures for the matching reporting period. Data Management \u2013 Robust systems are needed to collect, analyze, and report sustainability-related data effectively. Investing in advanced data management technologies and building internal capacity for data analytics is crucial for accuracy and reliability. Companies should understand the time and resources involved to meet annual reporting requirements. Reporting on more complex metrics, such as Scope 3 emissions, may require greater transition times than currently suggested in the CSDS. Stakeholder Engagement \u2013 Engaging with investors, customers, employees, and communities enhances transparency, builds trust, and identifies areas for improvement in sustainability performance. Companies should determine whether it is appropriate to incorporate additional international standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) Framework Application Guidance to meet their full reporting objectives and stakeholder expectations.\n\nThe introduction of the CSDS marks a significant milestone in Canada\u2019s journey towards sustainable and responsible business practices. Proactive engagement, strategic planning, and a commitment to transparency will be key for energy companies to navigate these new disclosure standards successfully. Embracing sustainability and ESG integration not only helps meet regulatory obligations but also drives positive social and environmental impact. It also represents a strategic opportunity in that compliance with the CSDS can enhance brand reputation, attract investment, and drive long-term value creation. Demonstrating a commitment to sustainability and ESG principles can differentiate companies in the market and provide a competitive edge.\n\nThe incorporation of the CSDS into Canadian securities legislation would further mainstream sustainability reporting. The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), an umbrella organization of provincial and territorial securities regulators, plays a central role in setting securities regulations across Canada. They have been engaged with the CSSB in developing and refining the CSDS within the Canadian context. Their endorsement and the integration of the CSDS through provincial and territorial securities legislation would significantly influence disclosure practices across various sectors, including energy.\n\nAlthough we cannot predict the future action of the CSA, here are some possibilities of how the CSA may incorporate the CSDS into its rules:\n\nEndorsement and Recognition \u2013 The CSA may formally endorse the CSDS as a recognized standard for sustainability reporting within Canadian capital markets. This would align with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) endorsement of the IFRS Sustainability Standards in July 2023. Incorporation into Regulatory Framework \u2013 The CSA may integrate specific requirements of the CSDS into the revisions of proposed National Instrument NI 51-107 Climate-related Disclosure Requirements. Guidance and Interpretive Aids \u2013 The CSA may provide guidance and interpretive aids to help companies understand and comply with the standard under the existing regulatory framework, such as National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations. Periodic Review and Updates \u2013 The CSA may periodically review and update its rules and guidance to reflect evolving best practices and emerging issues in sustainability reporting.\n\nThe formalization of these rules is expected in the coming year. With that said, it might be tempting to procrastinate or even ignore the coming regulations. You might be thinking they\u2019re voluntary (at this point), they don\u2019t apply to you (but your supply chain customers and suppliers are starting to use them as evaluation tools in your relationships), your shareholders haven\u2019t demanded them (yet), and no regulatory body is imposing them (but they\u2019ve indicated they might). At GLJ, we recognize that every company is at a different point in its ESG reporting journey and we\u2019ve helped many clients take their very first steps at disclosure as well as supported those with a long history of reporting. However, many companies that voluntarily make the commitment to be leaders in sustainability disclosures realize that this process takes much longer than anticipated at the start. Now is the time to give ESG reporting some thoughtful consideration for your operations before they are imposed. Our team of ESG specialists are industry experts. Get in touch with us to find out how we can make your move into ESG reporting smooth and advantageous for your business.\n\nAuthors:\n\nColleen Sherry, Vice President Sustainability and Emissions Management\n\nKelly Rutledge, Senior Analyst Sustainability and Emissions Management\n\nsustainability@gljpc.com"

            "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: A number of Canadian oil sands producers are still trading far below their pre-COVID levels.Todd Korol/Reuters\n\nA rapid rise in the price of Canadian crude is putting investors in an unusual position, prompting them to weigh environmental concerns against the copious cash flows that oil sands producers are now churning out.\n\nSince the start of year, the price of Western Canadian Select, which is heavy Canadian crude, has soared more than 75 per cent to around US$60 a barrel, returning to levels set in the fall of 2014 before energy prices collapsed worldwide. The recent rise tops the gains made by the North American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, which is up around 50 per cent this year.\n\nWith crude prices soaring, analysts expect Canadian oil sands producers to churn out substantial free cash flow in 2021. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. alone is expected to produce nearly $8-billion in 2021, according to a May estimate from RBC Dominion Securities \u2013 and that\u2019s after paying $2.2-billion worth of dividends. Suncor Energy Ltd., meanwhile, is expected to produce $6.4-billion after paying its own dividends.\n\nInvestors are starting to notice, and share prices have risen this year. But a number of Canadian oil sands producers are still trading far below their pre-COVID levels. MEG Energy Corp. , for example, closed at $8.91 Tuesday, compared with about $38 a share before energy prices collapsed in 2014.\n\nOil and gas well cleanup can mean jobs boom for Alberta, group says\n\nAlberta government buying a 50-per-cent stake in the Sturgeon Refinery\n\nAnalysts have attributed the persistent market weakness to the ESG era, in which investors are paying more attention to environmental, social and governance issues \u2013 and are therefore shying away from owning fossil fuel producers. A push to decarbonize the economy has also made people question just how long oil will be in popular demand.\n\nBut some counterarguments could tempt investors to reconsider. For one, oil sands producers are swimming in free cash flow, and the expectation is that they will use the money to boost their dividends. Suncor has targeted increasing its own dividend to around $2 a share in 2025, more than double the current level of 84 cents.\n\nThere is also more research being done on future demand for crude \u2013 and specifically, for Canadian heavy oil \u2013 that contradicts the narrative that the oil sands will soon be stranded assets. To this end, a recent study from CIBC World Markets argued that electric vehicles are \u201cnot a death sentence\u201d for all refined products, partly because heavy transport vehicles, such as airplanes, will maintain their demand for heavy oil.\n\nCIBC analysts also stressed that oil sands production is \u201ccost competitive in a world where focus shifts away from supply growth.\u201d Oil sands producers were once seen as uncompetitive relative to rival shale oil producers in the United States, but CIBC estimated that the all-in sustaining costs of the oil sands have fallen to US$25 to US$35 a barrel, compared with U.S. shale at US$25 to US$32.\n\nOddly enough, oil sands producers have the 2014 energy crash to thank for helping to close that gap.\n\nAfter crude prices tumbled when Saudi Arabia started flooding the world with oil in September, 2014, \u201cthe Canadian energy industry was effectively abandoned,\u201d Stacey McDonald, a director at natural gas producer Birchcliff Energy Ltd. and a former energy analyst at GMP Securities, said in an interview. In the aftermath, \u201cidle engineers, instead of working on growth projects, worked on optimizing current operations. \u2026 There was just no other way to survive.\u201d\n\nOver time, the cost of producing a barrel of oil sands crude dropped \u2013 and the fervour for U.S. shale oil producers also faded. The new-found American oil attracted scores of producers, and within a few years the market was oversupplied. Many funded their growth with debt, and their highly-levered balance sheets were incompatible with volatile crude prices, leading to multiple waves of bankruptcies.\n\nMany investors also fell out of love with U.S. crude because shale wells have high decline rates, which means the oil per well is produced rather quickly. In the oil sands, analysts stress that decline rates are almost negligible because there is so much crude sitting in the ground.\n\n\u201cCanadian energy companies, especially in the oil sands, can effectively compete against U.S. shale,\u201d Ms. McDonald said.\n\nCurrent cash flows alone likely won\u2019t be enough to win investors back. Gold miners learned this when the price of bullion soared above US$2,000 an ounce last year, yet many producers\u2019 share prices remained far below their peaks.\n\nTo help combat investors\u2019 growing aversion to fossil fuel producers, the largest oil sands producers have started making concrete commitments toward achieving net-zero carbon emissions. In May, Suncor pledged to cut its net-greenhouse gas emissions by one-third to 19 megatonnes annually, down from 29 megatonnes in 2019.\n\nHowever, the growing frequency of troubling weather events, such as annual forest fires and the recent heat wave that has engulfed Western Canada and the northwest U.S., will make it harder to win investors back.\n\nThe push toward electric vehicles also has investors spooked. Canada last week announced it aims to ban the sale of fuel-burning new cars and light-duty trucks starting in 2035. But CIBC\u2019s analysts believe oil sands crude might actually be a relatively safe harbour.\n\n\u201cWe view there to be a general misunderstanding of the relative supply/demand for the various grades of crude globally,\u201d they wrote in a recent report, adding that there is \u201ca global undersupply situation in heavier grades with declining volumes from Mexico and Venezuela.\u201d\n\nAlthough oil demand is likely to fall as the adoption of electric vehicles accelerates, the analysts noted that refiners are likely to retool and hunt for heavy oil to maximize production of jet and diesel fuels. A number of airlines have acknowledged they won\u2019t be able to use biofuels for many years.\n\nThe state of global oil supply is also a moving target, and it has burned investors before because the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has historically started pumping more when oil prices started to climb. Crude oil prices hit six-year highs early Tuesday, but then retreated as apparent disagreement among OPEC members raised concerns some countries may loosen restrictions on oil production.\n\n\u201cOn its face, the market certainly appears tight in that there is currently more crude being consumed than produced,\u201d Rory Johnston, a market economist, wrote recently in his Commodity Context newsletter. But he worries about OPEC+, which includes Russia, opening its taps again.\n\nHe also noted that while oil inventories have dropped significantly relative to 2020, they\u2019re still higher than pre-2014 levels. \u201cToday\u2019s market remains far from healthy,\u201d he wrote.\n\nYour time is valuable.

            "article_text": "We need to redefine who is an \u201cexpert\u201d.\n\nExperts cannot only include bureaucrats, politicians, academics, activists, and white-collar corporate elites. We must include the people who do the work to keep society functioning, such as electricians, utility system operators, and oilfield and construction workers.\n\nWho is given the mic (or the pen) is given the power to influence perceptions, sometimes resulting in demands for unworkable plans.\n\nThe Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) issued an emergency alert Saturday, January 13 asking Albertans to immediately reduce their electricity use or risk rotating outages. The extreme cold across the West caused an increase in demand and a restriction of imports, and that resulted in the worst-case scenario.\n\nAlbertans did what Albertans do \u2013 they pulled together and shut down unnecessary usage, averting a crisis.\n\nAlberta is a modern, energy-rich province, the envy of the world, in many ways. How did this crisis happen?\n\nReporting afterwards on the alert, Calgary newstalk radio QR 770 interviewed an \u201cexpert\u201d \u2013 a multi-degreed economics and law professor at an Alberta university and part-time climate activist. He said several words and asked a similar question, but otherwise contributed little of substance because he does not have adequate expertise to identify practicable solutions.\n\nI would like to know why QR 770 did not interview a utility system expert to explain what happened and why. AESO made experts available to media to answer questions. The role of the media is to inform the public, and that is best accomplished by interviewing a broad cross-section of people with real-world knowledge.\n\nThe Official Opposition in Alberta put out a statement trying to capitalize on the situation, as any political party would. Shadow Minister for Energy and Climate Nagwan Al-Guneid demanded immediate action be taken by the governing UCP while praising renewables for getting the province through the alert, and simultaneously forgetting it was her government that mandated all coal fired power plants be shut down by 2030. They even paid three power plant operators $1.36 billion to shut down their plants early.\n\nWind and solar renewables did not get Alberta through the most critical time \u2013 the coldest, darkest hours \u2013 of the electricity crisis and the data shows it. The assertion was at best missing context, and at worst disinformation for ideological gain.\n\nAgain, we need to redefine who is an \u201cexpert\u201d.\n\nThere is a place for opposition parties, academics, corporate leaders, and even activists. However, they have an obligation to be serious and come to the discussion table in good faith. Otherwise, we have people with severe climate anxiety and a decade of \u201cclimate-induced insomnia\u201d demanding that Canada build net zero hospitals powered by wind and solar to decarbonize and climate-proof the health care system.\n\nThe table must be expanded and seats added to include the people working closest to the source. Therefore, it would be beneficial for media organizations to interview the \u201cinvisible\u201d people who work thanklessly to keep the systems running so much so that we take them for granted. We could all benefit from better understanding how the world works and how things are made.\n\nI want to hear from electrical engineers, electricians, pipeline operators, oilfield workers, energy marketers, utility system operators, and anyone else who works to keep the electricity system functioning without fail.\n\nThey too must come to the discussion in good faith, ready to participate in complex but meaningful problem-solving discussions as their input is essential.\n\nThe reason the grid nearly failed and caused rolling blackouts is multi-faceted \u2013 extreme cold, taking coal plants offline early, not adding sufficient reliable power generation, renewables not producing during peak demand, increased population, increased business activity, and burdensome federal regulations, to name a few. It will take a truly diverse group of experts to build the grid that is able to withstand the most adverse weather to consistently deliver power during the coldest and deadliest times.\n\nOver the weekend there were pleas on social media to get adults in the room to address the electricity grid crisis. We will not get adults in the room to create prudent energy policy for real people until we redefine who is an \u201cexpert\u201d. This weekend proved that we need to do that soon.\n\nAbout Deidra Garyk\n\nDeidra Garyk has been working in the Canadian energy industry for almost 20 years.

            "article_text": "Tourmaline Oil Corp. shares jumped 15 per cent on Friday after it said it will spin off some of its assets into a royalty and energy infrastructure company worth $775-million, with the aim of taking it public.\n\nTourmaline will own 75 per cent to 81 per cent of the new entity, called Topaz Energy Corp., and unnamed private investors will own the remainder, paying $150-million to $200-million for their stake. The company said it could launch an initial public offering for the unit next year.\n\nShares in Tourmaline surged $1.66 to $12.38 on the Toronto Stock Exchange as investors applauded chief executive Mike Rose\u2019s plan to help the market recognize value not currently reflected in the company\u2019s stock price. The move comes after a more than 50 per cent drop in the stock in the past six months.\n\nTopaz\u2019s assets will initially comprise a gross overriding royalty on all of Tourmaline\u2019s oil and gas production, a 45-per-cent interest in two of its natural gas plants and a portion of third-party revenue from gas processing.\n\nTourmaline is among several natural gas producers that have been hit by depressed prices for the fuel through the spring and summer, and waning investor interest in the sector as a whole. Last month, eight energy companies were dropped from the S&P/TSX Composite Index because their market value had dropped below the required threshold. They were Birchcliff Energy Ltd., Ensign Energy Services Inc., Kelt Exploration Ltd., NuVista Energy Ltd., NexGen Energy Ltd., Precision Drilling Corp., Peyto Exploration & Development Corp. and Torc Oil & Gas Ltd.\n\nThe creation of Topaz, known as a drop-down, shows energy companies are looking for ways to shake the funk that enveloped even those producers considered to be well run with manageable debt, such as Tourmaline. It\u2019s in the same vein as two similar spin-offs by U.S. Permian oil producer Diamondback Energy Corp. \u2013 Viper Energy Partners LP, which acquired mineral interests from Diamondback; and Rattler Midstream LP, which bought infrastructure assets. Rattler completed a US$632-million IPO in May.\n\n\u201cThey have to evaluate it, because there\u2019s zero differentiation between the stocks,\u201d said Robert Fitzmartyn, analyst at GMP FirstEnergy. \u201cCompanies with long-life inventories [of gas reserves] are trading at the same levels as those without that. We keep hearing that the market wants consolidation but the ones that deserve to be the acquirers, the superior deployers of capital, don\u2019t have a cost of capital to do so, so they need to explore alternative avenues.\u201d\n\nMr. Fitzmartyn, who rates Tourmaline as a buy, increased his 12-month target price to $23.25 from $21. He SAID Topaz\u2019s equity value could be assessed in public markets at more than $1-billion, if investors assign similar financial metrics as royalty and energy infrastructure companies receive, such as PrairieSky Royalty Ltd. or Keyera Corp.\n\nTourmaline said it will use cash proceeds, estimated at $135-million to $185-million for potential acquisitions in its main operating areas, as well as debt reduction and to buy back shares. The transaction is also expected to boost its forecast cash flow per share by 5 per cent, it said.\n\n\u201cOverall we view this event positively, with the company demonstrating clear hidden asset value from its infrastructure and large asset base not currently reflected by the market in its equity valuation,\u201d AltaCorp Capital Inc. analyst Patrick O\u2019Rourke wrote in a research note.\n\nYour time is valuable.

            "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: An inactive Sequoia well site near Ponoka, Alta.Todd Korol/The Globe and Mail\n\nHarold Wang was driving a hard bargain. In the summer of 2016, the Hong Kong businessman was closing in on a sweetheart deal to acquire a major foothold in Alberta\u2019s oil patch by establishing a brand new company. The price tag: $1.\n\nFor weeks, he had been in talks with Calgary-based Perpetual Energy Inc. and its CEO, Sue Riddell Rose, to buy thousands of aging natural-gas wells. Despite the pittance he was preparing to pay, negotiations had bogged down. By early August Mr. Wang, who had previously worked at major U.S. investment banks, was firing off an e-mail to Ms. Riddell Rose in which he threatened to put the deal on hold.\n\nAfter all, the acquisition was not without major risks. Many of the wells were nearing the end of their economic life, and the deal included the assumption of future cleanup costs, pegged by the seller at $133.6-million; Mr. Wang\u2019s company simply did not have the financial wherewithal normally required to convince the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) that he could afford such a cleanup.\n\nNo matter, as that environmental bill had been glossed over: The deal had been structured in such a way that the AER \u2013 an industry-funded agency that operates at arm\u2019s length from the provincial government and is charged with both promoting and policing the oil business \u2013 would not be able to assess whether Mr. Wang\u2019s new company could meet the obligations.\n\nStill, he continued to play hardball. \u201cSue \u2013 it doesn\u2019t work for us,\u201d he wrote in an exchange with Perpetual\u2019s boss, whose family is among the most prominent in Calgary\u2019s business community.\n\n\u201cCome on Harold \u2026 you are exhausting me,\u201d Ms. Riddell Rose replied. \u201cPlease work with us on this.\u201d\n\nMr. Wang did not relent, and the next day he secured even sweeter terms. \u00adMs. Riddell Rose wrote back: \u201cOK Harold \u2026 you win.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was a complex deal that exemplifies the dangers of a brisk trade in high-liability energy assets now confounding governments and their regulators. Within 18 months, Mr. Wang\u2019s company, by then named Sequoia Resources Corp., would be insolvent, triggering disputes over how it was allowed to buy up energy properties in the first place \u2013 and who would cover the costly cleanup of the wells.\n\nThe Globe and Mail spent six months poring over court records and delving into thousands of pages of corporate and government documents, obtained via freedom-of-information laws, in an effort to shine a light on a murky corner of the oil and gas business that has flourished through the prolonged slump in commodity prices: the buying and selling of wells and production plants saddled with major environmental liabilities. Along the way, The Globe has also scoured oil- and gas-well databases in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, examined several companies\u2019 fiscal reports and public statements and interviewed dozens of industry executives, landowners and bankers.\n\nThe reporting points to a looming financial and environmental crisis: Of the 610,696 oil and gas wells in those three provinces, some 20 per cent are sitting inactive, according to The Globe\u2019s data. Almost two-thirds of these 122,456 idle wells have been shut off for more than five years. And a growing proportion are owned by companies that can least afford to clean them up \u2013 a process known as reclamation \u2013 when their commercial life ends. Costs have already overwhelmed dedicated cleanup funds set up by the industry, put a strain on regulators and prompted Alberta\u2019s NDP government to step in with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans.\n\nCumulative number of inactive wells 140,000 2018 Sask. 25,857 120,000 In 2005, Saskatchewan had 16,010 inactive wells 100,000 B.C. 7,382 80,000 60,000 Alta. 89,217 40,000 20,000 0 1999 2003 2007 2011 2015 Note: Saskatchewan only provided data for 2005 and 2018.

Led by Mr. Wang and financier Wentao Yang, it filed for bankruptcy this year after amassing thousands of wells and related facilities in a rapid-fire series of deals, starting with Perpetual\u2019s assets. It kept buying even though it did not have enough money to cover the costs of reclamation according to the AER\u2019s threshold of financial fitness. Mr. Wang\u2019s bargaining is detailed in an affidavit from Ms. Riddell Rose that is part of a lawsuit filed by the bankruptcy trustee, PricewaterhouseCoopers, in its efforts to recoup some of the costs for decommissioning the aging sites. Neither he nor Mr. Yang would comment for this story.\n\nIn the oil patch, pliant regulators have enabled well-known companies, including Husky Energy Inc., Enerplus Corp. and others, to foist cleanup costs onto small companies that are buying up the distressed wells of those bigger players. In some cases, those smaller players are purchasing the assets even though they are unable to secure financing from major banks.\n\nThe risky bet is that natural-gas prices will rebound and deliver payoffs big enough to generate profits while also funding the cleanup of old wells as they peter out.\n\nBut the gamble has stirred a backlash in the industry. It has also angered landowners who complain of being shortchanged on lease payments from energy companies. And ultimately it has left taxpayers to shoulder a financial and environmental mess. In Alberta, a string of corporate bankruptcies has already pushed the number of defunct well sites to 4,349, up from 545 in 2014, necessitating a $235-million loan from the provincial government last year to shore up the fund set aside by industry to pay for cleanup. And that count does not yet include any of Sequoia\u2019s wells.\n\nSequoia is just one player in a wider scheme that could push cleanup costs substantially higher for such wells across B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan. Depending on assumed costs for plugging and reclaiming wells, the tab could easily climb to $13.2-billion, and reach as high as $26.9-billion, if companies on the brink of insolvency and other struggling firms were to collapse, according to a Globe analysis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shell game,\u201d said Al Kemmere, president of the Rural Municipalities Association in Alberta, \u201cthat we have no ability \u2026 to control.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Brad Maynes, left, and Ken Wright of the City of Medicine Hat\u2019s Natural Gas and Petroleum Resources division discuss an abandoned gas well site on the outskirts of the city.Todd Korol/Globe and Mail\n\nGlossary Active A well that is producing oil and gas\n\nInactive A well that is not producing oil and gas and has not been plugged\n\nPlugged The well has been filled with cement and its wellhead has been removed and capped. This type of well is also known as abandoned\n\nReclaimed The well site has been returned to its original state and a reclamation certificate has been issued\n\nOrphaned The well has no owner because the owner is bankrupt. The well and its cleanup costs have been transferred to an orphan well fund\n\nThrough the middle of the past decade, natural gas was Canada\u2019s economic trump card. Tight U.S. supplies pushed up prices, providing incentives for companies to tap even small, shallow reserves across the Prairies. The upshot: a drilling boom that sent profits soaring \u2013 and royalties gushing into provincial budgets.\n\nBut then came the shale-gas fracking revolution, which allowed the U.S. industry to access massive reserves near major population centres. Early this month, Alberta gas was selling for less than $2 a unit. That\u2019s one-sixth what it fetched at the market peak in 2005 \u2013 and even less than the $3 and change it got in 2014. This past summer gas traded, at times, for negative values.\n\nMedicine Hat, Alta., is struggling with the new market reality. Some wells in the city date back more than a century. Over the years, the city itself had become an active gas driller, padding the municipal budget with large dividends.\n\nBut today drillers are largely bypassing this corner of Alberta. New investment is more likely to come from an altogether different sector: On a 71-acre spread near the city\u2019s outskirts sits the makings of Aurora Cannabis Inc.\u2019s massive greenhouse. The civic moniker, \u201cThe Gas City,\u201d feels distinctly out of date. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen new gas drilling for a long, long time down here,\u201d said Brad Maynes, manager of the municipal energy division.\n\nAcross the Prairies, the prolonged downturn in prices has aggravated concerns, as inactive wells \u2013 and their future cleanup costs \u2013 languish on the books of Perpetual, Husky, Enerplus and others. As wells age and production declines, such obligations are like pension funds faced with growing payouts as beneficiaries retire, says Jeremy McCrea, an analyst at Raymond James Ltd. in Calgary.\n\nMeanwhile, costs such as maintenance, lease payments to landowners and municipal taxes remain elevated, even as production falls. None of which pleases investors. \u201cCompanies with higher abandonment liabilities trade at a bigger discount than their peers,\u201d Mr. McCrea noted.\n\nKeith Wilson, an Edmonton-based lawyer who represents landowners in disputes with energy companies, is blunt. \u201cThe commerce of the business is to take high-value producing wells, produce them as much as you can, and then, as soon as the economics become marginal, hand them off to someone else and include the liability within it,\u201d he said.\n\nAlong with those liabilities have come growing risks for governments, as companies with weak finances have snapped up money-losing wells in an ill-advised roll of the dice on natural-gas prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrisk Business At least 140,367 oil and gas wells have changed hands in Western Canada since 2015, some for as little as $1.

The chart depicts transfers of 100 wells or more, involving the top 10 sellers.\n\nThe deal-making has been heady. Data compiled by The Globe from Canada\u2019s three westernmost provinces show that at least 140,367 oil and gas wells have changed hands since 2015, the year after the price crash took hold. Of those, almost half were transferred to companies with subpar financial status as determined by Alberta\u2019s regulator. Buyers include holding companies and firms that are anything but household names, such as ACCEL Canada Holdings Ltd., Acquisition Oil Corp. and COR4 Oil Corp. Many are small firms with only a handful of employees and were created in the past few years.\n\nIn 2016, the AER did, in fact, toughen rules, essentially requiring that the value of a company\u2019s assets be at least twice the deemed liabilities upon completion of an acquisition. But the standard has been only loosely enforced. Meanwhile, some companies have gone to great pains to simply circumvent the scrutiny. Perpetual Energy set up a structure that allowed it to do just that, Sequoia\u2019s bankruptcy trustee alleges in the suit filed against Perpetual and Ms. Riddell Rose. Rather than transferring assets to Mr. Wang\u2019s outfit, the suit alleges, Perpetual sold shares of an established subsidiary that held the wells.\n\nOne result: The AER was prevented from ruling on the deal\u2019s acceptability.\n\nMs. Riddell Rose denies that was the reason for setting up the structure, saying, rather, that it just made things simpler, given the many and varied assets Perpetual was parting with.\n\nThe trustee, PricewaterhouseCoopers, alleges in its suit that Perpetual and its CEO knew the hefty liabilities in the deal would render Sequoia insolvent \u2013 a charge both she and Perpetual deny. The trustee is seeking $217-million in damages on behalf of creditors \u2013 which include major energy companies, suppliers and municipalities \u2013 if it fails to convince a judge to annul the sale. The allegations have not been proved in court.\n\nBut one thing is certain: The Perpetual transaction sparked a deal spree by Sequoia. Sources close to the company say it kept buying in order to achieve a large enough asset collection to make it of interest to Chinese investors. Along the way, it sought breaks on millions of dollars in unpaid municipal taxes.\n\nUltimately, however, such efforts weren\u2019t enough to salvage the faulty business plan, as gas prices plunged even lower, sinking any hope of attracting outside capital.\n\nBy far Sequoia\u2019s biggest creditor is the AER, which is on the hook for $225-million to decommission the company\u2019s 3,200 or so wells and related facilities in Alberta. The regulator has acknowledged the loopholes that saddled it with those costs. But it has yet to say how it will close them.\n\nThe wider trade in distressed oil and gas assets is playing out as a glut of heavy crude in Alberta sparks calls from some executives for government relief. In recent weeks, prices for oil sands crude have plunged to such a degree that some of the industry\u2019s most financially resilient players are now urging the province to legislate supply quotas to end a crisis they insist is hurting not only companies but government revenues and the broader economy.\n\nThe trafficking in aging wells has garnered comparatively few headlines, but it bears some resemblance to the U.S. subprime-mortgage crisis, in which borrowers with little financial capacity racked up big debts that were bundled and sold as securities. Defaults on those mortgages were a factor in the near-collapse of the global financial system in 2008. In this case, it isn\u2019t mortgage holders who can\u2019t make their house payments, but oil companies that do not measure up to the regulator\u2019s version of a credit score.\n\n\u201cWe know that we have to make sure that, to the best of our ability, very risky transfers don\u2019t take place, while at the same time making sure that economic activity through mergers and acquisitions in this province can move forward,\u201d AER president and CEO Jim Ellis told reporters in August. (The AER announced this month that Mr. Ellis will be resigning in January.)\n\nBut if the AER was worried about risky asset transfers, it did little to stop Sequoia from piling on more liabilities. Just days after the purchase of Perpetual\u2019s assets closed in late 2016, a bankruptcy receiver for insolvent Waldron Energy Corp. contacted AER staff with an urgent request: A prospective buyer, later revealed to be Sequoia Resources, was interested in about 225 of Waldron\u2019s money-losing wells and other equipment.\n\nBut there was a catch: AER rules prevented the buyer from acquiring the assets. FTI Consulting Canada Inc., the receiver whose job it was to liquidate Waldron\u2019s assets, asked the AER to apply discretion.\n\nApproval came swiftly. \u201cWill be nice to have this one wrapped up for Xmas break,\u201d Marvin Koochin, then a receivership-and-compliance specialist at AER\u2019s liability-management branch, told colleagues in a Dec. 21, 2016, e-mail.\n\nIt was not an isolated exemption. Since June, 2016, the AER says it has received 373 requests to relax its toughened rules. Of those, it has denied only 23.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Abandoned Sequoia facilities at a well site near Ponoka, Alta. Sequoia filed for bankruptcy this year.Todd Korol/Globe and Mail\n\nIn the case of Sequoia, e-mail correspondence shows that executives repeatedly assured AER staff that the company had a plan to arrest financial losses inherited from Perpetual, even as Sequoia snapped up distressed assets from Waldron and another bankrupt energy producer, Endurance Energy Ltd. The AER has said it did not collect security deposits \u2013 typically required in transfers of wells to financially precarious producers \u2013 in several of the deals.\n\nThen, in June of 2017, Sequoia Resources bought natural-gas assets that were burdened with $22.8-million in associated liabilities from Husky Energy. As part of the deal, Husky gave Sequoia $6.5-million, with half of that held in escrow to help pay for well cleanup over two years.\n\nTwo months later, Sequoia\u2019s Mr. Wang and Mr. Yang agreed to acquire another 2,644 wells from Husky, with liabilities of $135-million. Almost 50 per cent of the wells were inactive, according to documents filed with the regulator outlining the purchase. This time around, the buyer was not Sequoia Resources but Sequoia Operating Corp., a related company run by the same management and from the same office.\n\nSequoia Operating, which now goes by the name AlphaBow Energy, also picked up assets at bargain prices from OMERS Energy, Superman Resources and debt-saddled Pengrowth Energy Corp.\n\nEvery single deal received the AER\u2019s blessing.\n\nIn the deals with Husky, Sequoia\u2019s principals filed what\u2019s known as a discretionary-approval request form asking the AER to relax rules that were established, in the regulator\u2019s own words, \u201cto protect Albertans from unfunded liabilities.\u201d\n\nThe paperwork was routine. On Aug. 4, 2017, Vicki Benoit, chief operating officer of Sequoia Operating, wrote to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Beer, then the AER\u2019s director of closure and liability, outlining plans to buy what she called \u201clow-risk oil and gas wells\u201d from Husky.\n\nBy its own math, however, Sequoia\u2019s financial position would deteriorate as a result of the transaction, according to documents it filed with the regulator in support of the asset-transfer process.\n\nFor Husky, majority-owned by companies controlled by the family of now-retired Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, the sales were part of wider efforts to shore up finances bruised by the collapse in oil prices. By late 2017, Husky had shed about $840-million in long-term cleanup obligations, primarily through asset sales in Western Canada.\n\nHusky spokesman Mel Duvall insists the company takes into account the creditworthiness of purchasers and prevailing market conditions before it sells assets and will include money for cleanup if needed. He would not comment on the specific terms of many of the transactions, but he noted that AlphaBow Energy remains a solvent operator. He said Husky had spent $136-million on well cleanup in 2017, up from $87-million in 2016.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail to The Globe, \u201cwe see the regulator working at balancing the benefit of maintaining production to support the local economy, generate royalties, taxes and lease payments against the potential risks of transferring assets and liabilities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife cycle of an oil and gas well The life of an oil or gas well can be long, spanning an average of 20 to 30 years. When a well reaches the end of its production life, it can enter a period of dormancy before finally being abandoned and decommissioned. Abandoning a non-producing well can be an expensive proposition entailing plugging, sealing it with concrete and cleaning up any possible contamination. The final step is restoring the land to its original state. 1 Identification and drilling After locating an oil or gas deposit and obtaining rights, a drilling rig is brought in to bore a hole to the licensed depth. The wellbore is lined with a steel casing to prevent collapse and groundwater contamination. Drilling mud is pumped continuously to wash out drilling debris. Play animation 2 Determining a well\u2019s status Once a well is completed, production tubing is inserted and the drilling rig is replaced by \u2018Christmas tree\u2019 valves or a pump if the pressure of hydrocarbons is insufficient. A well is deemed active if it produces \u201cvolumetric activity\u201d or flow. It is considered inactive after months of no activity. In Alberta, suspended wells are inactive wells that follow strictly regulated safety procedures. Play animation 3 Abandonment and decommissioning Abandoning and decommissioning a well is a long process. It entails removing the pumps and other production equipment, filling the wellbore with cement and capping the wellhead according to provincial and federal regulations to prevent contamination of the surrounding area. Play animation 4 Restoration The final step in abandoning a well is reclaiming the land and returning it to its original state. Energy companies must follow a detailed plan, removing any hazards or contamination. In Alberta, for example, the regulator issues a certificate when this process is complete.

HOWE INSTITUTE; ENERGY-FUTURE.ORG; ALBERTA ENERGY REGULATOR Note: Simplified process of a typical vertical well, not to scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequoia\u2019s collapse has cast a critical light on the AER\u2019s ability to gauge financial risk, not least when assets change hands. This year, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. \u2013 the oil-and-gas giant chaired by billionaire Murray Edwards \u2013 has launched dozens of regulatory appeals and several lawsuits to block deals it says expose the industry to billions of dollars in cleanup costs due to the perceived insufficient funds of buyers.\n\nSuch costs are borne by the industry cleanup fund; payments are proportional to a company\u2019s liabilities. CNRL\u2019s extensive holdings and sizable backlog of dormant wells effectively mean it foots the largest share of the bill when other players fail.\n\nIt argues that current regulations make it too easy to transfer liabilities to thinly financed producers. \u201cObviously we\u2019re concerned,\u201d said CNRL president Tim McKay. But, he added, the company is \u201cworking proactively with the government to enhance the rules.\u201d\n\nHe would not discuss specifics \u2013 whether, for example, companies should be required to post cleanup bonds upfront, before they drill a well. But it\u2019s clear CNRL\u2019s interventions are not limited to Alberta. It has sued Predator Oil BC Ltd. and Ranch Energy Corp. over a complex transaction in B.C.\n\nRanch Energy billed itself as a specialist in buying up and reclaiming aging assets burdened with expensive cleanup obligations. According to affidavits filed as part of the company\u2019s receivership proceedings, it aimed to use cash flow from the production of oil and gas to systematically clean up wells as they petered out. In this case, the cash was also needed to pay off a hefty debt in a related business (providing airplane and helicopter service to the oil industry) for which Ranch was in default.\n\nThe acquisition was effectively a flier on gas prices, one that proved tragically optimistic. It was a flawed business plan that also triggered a court battle with Ranch\u2019s lender over what to do with assets carrying tens of millions of dollars in abandonment costs. Ranch\u2019s insolvency now threatens to add to the province\u2019s growing tally of defunct sites.\n\nThat number has swelled to 294, up from just 24 in 2014, according to the BC Oil and Gas Commission, the provincial agency that hands out drilling permits and oversees asset transfers between companies. The increase has overwhelmed cleanup funds in B.C. Just $5.3-million was available as of March, 2017, against a total cleanup cost estimated at $40-million to $60-million.\n\nFive largest well owners with major liabilities Companies with an asset-to-liability ratio at or lower than 2 Active, plugged and reclaimed wells Inactive wells Alberta Torxen Energy 16,566 IPC Alberta 12,304 Ember Resources 11,151 Obsidian Energy 8,639 Lynx Energy 6,611 Saskatchewan Canadian Natural Resources 20,548 ISH Energy 2,493 Abbey Resources 2,345 Pine Cliff Energy 1,669 Medicine Hat owns these wells in Saskatchewan and 2,276 wells in Alberta City of Medicine Hat 1,368 British Columbia Canadian Natural Resources 6,942 Shanghai Energy 1,187 Predator Oil BC 876 Canlin Energy 855 Pengrowth Energy 745 Five largest well owners with major liabilities Companies with an asset-to-liability ratio at or lower than 2 Active, plugged and reclaimed wells Inactive wells Alberta Torxen Energy 16,566 IPC Alberta 12,304 Ember Resources 11,151 Obsidian Energy 8,639 Lynx Energy 6,611 Saskatchewan Canadian Natural Resources 20,548 ISH Energy 2,493 Medicine Hat owns these wells in Saskatchewan and 2,276 wells in Alberta Abbey Resources 2,345 Pine Cliff Energy 1,669 City of Medicine Hat 1,368 British Columbia Canadian Natural Resources 6,942 Shanghai Energy 1,187 Predator Oil BC 876 Canlin Energy 855 Pengrowth Energy 745 Five largest well owners with major liabilities Companies with an asset-to-liability ratio at or lower than 2 Active, plugged and reclaimed wells Inactive wells Alberta Torxen Energy 16,566 IPC Alberta 12,304 Ember Resources 11,151 Obsidian Energy 8,639 Lynx Energy 6,611 Saskatchewan Canadian Natural Resources 20,548 ISH Energy 2,493 Abbey Resources 2,345 Pine Cliff Energy 1,669 Medicine Hat owns these wells in Saskatchewan and 2,276 wells in Alberta City of Medicine Hat 1,368 British Columbia Canadian Natural Resources 6,942 Shanghai Energy 1,187 Predator Oil BC 876 Canlin Energy 855 Pengrowth Energy 745\n\nWhat could well cleanup costs be in Western Canada?

B.C.\n\nDocuments from legal actions surrounding the Ranch saga portray a large company selling off past-their-prime wells to a smaller player with insufficient finances by setting up a deal structure that skirted government rules. The attempt ended in disarray.\n\nIn 2017, Ranch Energy bought interests in 1,600 wells and other equipment in northeastern B.C. from Predator, which had earlier purchased the wells from Penn West Petroleum Ltd. (now called Obsidian Energy Inc.), a much larger company than either Ranch or Predator. Penn West itself had long struggled with high abandonment liabilities due to a history of acquisitions.\n\nRanch CEO Ryan Tobber had created his company that spring to acquire the Predator assets, located near Fort St. John. All but a fraction of the wells pumped natural gas.\n\nBut there was a snag: Ranch\u2019s balance sheet did not meet the BC Oil and Gas Commission\u2019s threshold for financial health. It would cost an estimated $105-million to clean up all the wells \u2013 about $2-million more than they were worth in the market. Court documents show that Third Eye Capital of Toronto advanced Ranch $10-million to buy the assets. To complete the deal, Predator agreed to hold the licences in trust until the commission deemed Ranch\u2019s books healthy. Predator also posted a letter of credit for $15-million to satisfy the regulator\u2019s requirement for financial assurances.\n\nUnder this complex arrangement, Ranch essentially took ownership of the wells, while Predator still held the operating permits. Mr. Tobber then formed a numbered company and acquired all of Predator\u2019s shares in a corporate takeover, making him its sole shareholder as well as its CEO.\n\nIn an affidavit filed in an Alberta court this past July, he notes that Ranch\u2019s cash flows were sapped by a 60-per-cent drop in natural-gas prices since the time he bought the assets. Even so, he took on more debt \u2013 and even proposed buying more wells. He did not return an e-mail and a phone call seeking comment.\n\nIn the end, Ranch defaulted on its loans to Third Eye and was pushed into receivership by the lender. Last month, an Alberta court allowed for a sale process of the wells to begin, opening the door to yet another operator taking on those hefty liabilities \u2013 assuming a buyer emerges at all.\n\nThe receiver, Ernst & Young, scrapped the trust agreement between Ranch and Predator, under which Ranch owned the assets while Predator held the related permits. It did so largely because Ranch could not foreseeably raise enough cash to satisfy BC Oil and Gas Commission requirements to own the permits \u2013 and also due to doubts over Mr. Tobber\u2019s business savvy. The receiver also noted that the wells were quickly falling into disrepair, citing a pipeline leak last July and an ongoing dispute over disposal of wastewater left behind by drilling operations. Neither Third Eye nor Ernst & Young would comment when contacted by The Globe.\n\nThe BC Oil and Gas Commission said it is monitoring the proceedings closely and will take the steps necessary to make sure the public and environment are protected.\n\nCNRL has joint interests in several of the wells that predate the Ranch deal. It is suing both Predator and Ranch for $2.4-million for unpaid bills related to road-sharing and other agreements. CNRL wants a judge to declare that Predator\u2019s sale of the assets to Ranch \u201cwas of no force and effect\u201d \u2013 in other words, that it never really occurred.\n\nIn its statement of claim, CNRL said it had previously objected on five occasions to the sale, stressing that it \u201chad concerns relating to Ranch\u2019s ability to meet future financial obligations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: An abandoned Redwater Energy site near St. Albert, Alta. Redwater\u2019s bankruptcy has led to a Supreme Court challenge.Todd Korol/Globe and Mail\n\nAcross Western Canada, regulators insist they are paying close attention to who is buying oil and gas wells. This past April \u2013 on the heels of a fiscal year in which the BC Oil and Gas Commission says it rejected two of 60 permit-transfer applications, and where nearly a third of the wells in the province are inactive \u2013 the B.C. government enacted legislation to increase an industry levy that funds the cleanup of defunct sites. It is also toughening regulations, with the aim of preventing operators with checkered histories from producing oil and gas in the province.\n\nIn Alberta, the AER is embroiled in a Supreme Court case involving insolvent Redwater Energy Corp. At issue is a lower-court ruling, from 2016, that effectively put the interests of secured creditors \u2013 including provincially owned ATB Financial \u2013 to recoup money on soured loans ahead of regulators\u2019 ability to enforce the cleanup of old, unproductive wells when a company goes bust. A decision from the top court is expected soon. Should its appeal fail, the AER has warned of more pressure on an already strained system.\n\nAnd strained it is: CNRL, lawyers and landowners have all criticized the regulator for lowballing risks. Industrywide, the AER pegs total liabilities at about $58.7-billion. In fact, documents made public by the regulator say the industry\u2019s ultimate cleanup bill for everything from pipelines to tailings pits could swell to $260-billion.\n\nAgainst such risks, the regulator says it has collected about $1.6-billion in security deposits.\n\nMeanwhile, a wider policy review to address the glut of dormant wells and future industry liabilities that was launched by Premier Rachel Notley\u2019s NDP government has stalled after initial consultations. A spokesman for Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd said the minister was unavailable for comment. Alberta\u2019s Auditor-General is also studying the issue but is not expected to release findings until after next spring\u2019s general election.\n\nPolicymakers in Saskatchewan have floated changes that would require companies to post higher security deposits when transfers involve large numbers of wells facing major cleanup obligations. The provincial Ministry of Energy and Resources has tested the new model and insists it ensures enough money is collected to cover eventual cleanups.\n\nPublicly, at least, even the industry itself says it is on board. \u201cWe want to make sure that the participants in the market are willing and able to discharge their end-of-life obligations,\u201d said Brad Herald, vice-president of Western Canada operations for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.\n\nBut many likely won\u2019t be able to meet those obligations. In Alberta alone, 45 per cent of producers are in a precarious financial state, according to the regulator\u2019s financial test. These companies account for 28,523 wells. They include SanLing Energy Ltd. and Houston Oil and Gas Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: An Abbey Resources well site near Lancer, Sask. Farmers are calling on Abbey to enhance weed control around its sites.Todd Korol/Globe and Mail\n\nThe problems aren\u2019t going away.\n\nStretching beneath an immense swath of flat prairie and rolling sand hills, the Shackleton gas field in southwestern Saskatchewan once minted fortunes for investors. In 2002, Husky announced plans to drill 170 wells in the newly discovered shallow-gas reserve. Four years later, a company called Profico Energy Management Ltd. sold its holdings in the region to Focus Energy Trust in a $1.2-billion deal. Focus then merged with a forerunner of Enerplus in a transaction worth about $1.4-billion.\n\nThese days, following a decade of low gas prices, production has slowed to a trickle. Husky and Enerplus have handed off most of their wells to little-known Abbey Resources Corp. The company\u2019s president, Jim Gettis, has conceded he acquired some of the drilling leases for as little as $10, a minuscule sum for assets that once changed hands in billion-dollar deals.\n\nBut despite that sweet entry fee, Mr. Gettis says he needs to cut costs if he is to revive the wells and make his business plan work.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what he told farmers at a meeting at the Living Sky Casino in Swift Current, Sask., this past April. In his pitch, now posted on YouTube, he asks farmers to swallow a 50-per-cent cut in lease payments \u2013 which can run between $1,000 and $3,000 a year \u2013 for wells on their grain fields. He also outlines plans to ask local municipalities for a tax break. Just before the meeting, he had been proposing to offer shares in Abbey in lieu of annual lease payments, but he scrapped that idea when it became clear it wouldn\u2019t fly with the 100-plus farmers in the casino\u2019s theatre.\n\nMonths later, about a dozen farmers gathered for coffee on an early September morning in a former grocery store they chipped in to buy and turned into their hub. And they were still steaming.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Farmers meet for early morning coffee in Lancer, Sask. They are frustrated that Abbey Resources is not paying its full lease payments.Todd Korol/Globe and Mail\n\nAfter the casino meeting, the company had sent a letter to each farmer stating that Abbey was immediately cutting its lease payment in half \u2013 and that cashing the enclosed cheque would signal acceptance of the company\u2019s \u201crent reduction program.\u201d For those who didn\u2019t accept, their wells \u201cwill have to be abandoned,\u201d read the letter, signed by Mr. Gettis.\n\nSome of those farmers that September morning planned to seek legal advice. Others had cashed the cheques and sent their own letters back, stating they did not agree to the rent-reduction terms and that they expected their contracts to be honoured in full.\n\nMr. Gettis declined to respond to detailed questions from The Globe. In an e-mail, he wrote that \u201cAbbey is a private company and discussing private issues in public at this stage is not in the best interest of Abbey or the stakeholders who continue to benefit. In fact, it would put the recovery plan at risk.\u201d\n\nFarmers aren\u2019t the only ones being shortchanged. Instead of paying its full 2017 and 2018 property taxes \u2013 totalling more than $3-million \u2013 to four regional municipalities and the local school division, Abbey instead tried to cut deals with them. Two municipalities have refused his terms; one has partially agreed, while the other recently accepted.\n\nAll of which, farmers say, raises another question: If Abbey can\u2019t afford its rent and taxes, how can it afford to maintain its wells \u2013 and clean them up when they\u2019re no longer productive? And if it can\u2019t do that, why was it allowed to acquire them at all?\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Near an Abbey gas well, farmer Kelly Bradford checks his wheat crop outside of Lancer, Sask.Todd Korol/Globe and Mail\n\nThe answer, at least in part: A letter of credit \u2013 guaranteeing payments of almost $28-million in the event that Abbey fails and can\u2019t clean up its 2,345 wells \u2013 has been posted with the Saskatchewan government. But not by Abbey; it didn\u2019t have the funds. Enerplus and Husky committed the security deposit instead, said a spokesperson with the Ministry of Energy and Resources.\n\nThat might have helped smooth the way to Abbey assuming custody of the assets \u2013 but landowners say it won\u2019t be enough, should Abbey\u2019s plans not pan out, to plug and reclaim all the wells. And there are lots of them: They would nearly sextuple the province\u2019s so-called orphan-well count, currently at 516, unless yet another company were to buy them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too easy for these people to buy a company or properties,\u201d said farmer Barry Tuchscherer, \u201cand not worry about the liability.\u201d Mr. Tuchscherer knows the Shackleton gas field intimately: He was a lead operator, akin to a foreman, for Enerplus for 15 years. The company was a good employer, he says. It cleaned up many wells that were no longer viable and it paid farmers lease payments in full.\n\nBut he thinks the government should collect more money up front from companies when times are good, so that the cash is there for reclamation when a downturn comes along.\n\nIndeed, while many are angry with Abbey, farmer Kelly Bradford\u2019s ire is reserved, in the main, for Enerplus. While taking a Globe reporter on a tour of neglected Shackleton wells, he described Mr. Gettis as a businessman playing the game. \u201cThose wells should have stayed with Enerplus, and they should have used their deep pockets and cleaned it up,\u201d he said, \u201cjust like everybody else does in business.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Drew Mair, manager of investor relations for Enerplus, said it transferred its Shackleton wells because they were no longer essential to its core business. In any case, he added, Enerplus is not offloading its environmental responsibility; he noted it is reclaiming 600 wells, at its own expense, that Abbey didn\u2019t want.\n\nFrom that perspective, Mr. Mair said, \u201cwe\u2019re not shirking any responsibility.\u201d\n\nA booming trade of unprofitable oil and gas wells in Western Canada is allowing companies to evade cleanup costs. Just a few years after the oil boom, energy companies are shedding distressed wells in Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan for next to nothing. And it\u2019s going virtually unchecked by regulators.

At first, he wasn\u2019t sure what the fuss was about. But sitting on a bus en route to the Dead Sea, he learned the company was changing its name\u2014to Ovintiv, of all things\u2014and, more jarring, abandoning Calgary for Denver. \u201cThat was pretty much the worst day of my career,\u201d says Morgan.\n\nBy then, he hadn\u2019t been close to Encana for over a decade\u2014he retired as CEO in 2005\u2014but it was still his baby. He\u2019d spent three decades toiling over unconventional oil and gas assets to create what he called a \u201cglobal super-independent,\u201d and he was the driving force behind a 2002 merger to create a company big and strong enough to be protected from U.S. suitors desperate to get their hands on Canadian energy assets.\n\nMorgan and his wife, Pat Trottier, had even named the company themselves, settling on Encana\u2014a portmanteau of \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201cCanada\u201d\u2014while cross-country skiing. So the rebrand felt like a twist of the knife. \u201cThere was no need to do that,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cThat really pissed me off.\u201d\n\nBlessed with all the advantages an energy firm could want, including some royalty-free acreage and a reputation as a low-cost producer, Encana once seemed unstoppable. For a time, it was Canada\u2019s most valuable company, worth more than even Royal Bank of Canada. Its crescent-shaped skyscraper, the Bow, was designed by some of the world\u2019s top architects, signalling Calgary as a global energy power.\n\nYet, starting in 2009, Encana spun off its oil sands assets (at an unfortunate time) under the direction of Morgan\u2019s hand-picked successor, Randy Eresman; brought in American executive Doug Suttles, who paid premium prices to shift the company\u2019s centre of gravity south of the border; wrote down US$20 billion in assets; and changed its strategy so many times that no one really knew what it stood for anymore. Since December 2009\u2014when it hived off its oil assets into Cenovus Energy\u2014Encana\u2019s shares have lost 80% of their value (meaning RBC is now 20 times larger by market cap).\n\nSomething had to give. But ditching Calgary altogether? In the words of Cenovus\u2019s CEO, Alex Pourbaix, it was a \u201ctragedy for Canada.\u201d Encana\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre was to be the energy giant that could never fall into foreign hands. \u201cThe driving force behind the merger, the driving force behind my career, the driving force behind everything, was a great Canadian-headquartered company that would never move,\u201d Morgan says from his home on the Saanich Peninsula, north of Victoria.\n\nWhen the news broke, everyone wanted to blame someone else for the pending loss of an Alberta icon. It was all Justin Trudeau\u2019s fault for turning investors off Canadian oil and gas, or Eresman\u2019s for splitting off the oil assets, or the board\u2019s for hiring an outsider, or Suttles\u2019s for ignoring the company\u2019s Canadian roots.\n\nBut in January 2020, Encana\u2014soon to be Ovintiv\u2014won shareholder approval for its plan to relocate stateside. Then COVID-19 hit, and the company slipped south with no further debate.\n\nAnd so, a little over a year later, the mystery remains: Who really killed Encana?\n\nThe gas giant formerly known as Encana used to be two companies. PanCanadian Energy, once part of the Canadian Pacific empire, controlled swaths of royalty-free acreage given to CP through an 1880s land grant from Ottawa. In fall 2001, the oil and gas unit was spun off in the \u201cstarburst\u201d deal that also saw the conglomerate\u2019s railway, hotel, shipping and coal-mining operations set free as stand-alone businesses.\n\nRival Alberta Energy Co., meanwhile, started out as a provincial Crown corporation with drilling rights to massive military ranges in the eastern part of the province. AEC, as it was known, went public in 1975 under Premier Peter Lougheed, and its shares were sold to Alberta residents for $10 each. The goal was for moms and pops to own a piece of the Western dream. Morgan was one of AEC\u2019s first employees.\n\nThe two companies came together on a Sunday in late January 2002, when Morgan and David O\u2019Brien, PanCanadian\u2019s chair and interim CEO, heralded the formation of EnCana (the \u201cC\u201d was originally capitalized) at the Palliser Hotel in downtown Calgary. They billed it as a \u201cCanadian-headquartered, world-class independent oil and gas company.\u201d And with an enterprise value of $27 billion, it instantly became a national champion that could show off its technological know-how in oil and gas basins around the world.\n\nBesides its dominance in Western Canada, Encana had operations off Canada\u2019s east coast and in the U.S. Rockies, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Ecuador. It controlled Canada\u2019s main gas storage and trading hub in southeastern Alberta; a promising offshore gas project off the coast of Nova Scotia, Deep Panuke; and two state-of-the art steam-driven oil sands projects near Fort McMurray, Foster Creek and Christina Lake.\n\nEncana\u2019s creation was a relief to many in the oil patch. With the loonie so cheap, there had been a simmering worry that Canada could lose its best-known players to U.S. rivals. That fear was well-founded: Within a five-month span in 2001, Gulf Canada Resources, Anderson Exploration and Canadian Hunter Exploration were all swallowed. And after the abrupt resignation of PanCanadian\u2019s CEO, David Tuer, in October 2001, the standalone company had a target on its back.\n\nWith Morgan as CEO and O\u2019Brien as board chair, Encana expanded by drilling in the U.S. and plunking down billions of dollars for natural gas assets in Colorado and Texas. Then, little by little, it divested its international assets, with Morgan choosing to focus on what the company did best: coaxing more oil and gas out of the ground in Canada and the U.S. for less and less money.\n\nThe timing couldn\u2019t have been better\u2014for both Encana\u2019s shareholders and for Morgan\u2019s legacy as CEO. Oil prices were starting an unprecedented run toward US$150 a barrel, and the price of natural gas began its surge beyond US$10 per million British thermal units (BTUs) amid fears of a continent-wide shortage.\n\nEmployees from Encana\u2019s early days recall a high-performance atmosphere. As head of the old AEC, Morgan\u2014a rural Alberta boy\u2014had been a whiz at fostering corporate culture. He set clear production and financial goals, and rewarded employees when they met so-called stretch targets. (He used an elastic Gumby doll as a mascot, and it even showed up at the company Christmas party. \u201cIt was pretty corny,\u201d he says, chuckling.)\n\nMorgan built on that style at Encana. The workers were known as Encanans, and it was a moniker he embraced. Morgan was the charismatic boss, while his operations chief, Eresman, was known for his technical smarts, devising plans for Encana\u2019s projects and seeing them through. \u201cGwyn liked to be the spokesperson and the leader and the visionary and the communicator,\u201d says Ryder McRitchie, who came to Encana via PanCanadian as a young engineer and rose to the executive ranks, leading investor relations and communications before leaving in 2015. \u201cRandy was a true engineer, operator, executor. He knew how to get things done. It was a good combo.\u201d\n\nSoon, Calgary saw Encana as part of the corporate home team, much like WestJet Airlines and CP Rail. Albertans who didn\u2019t even work there took it as a point of pride when, in 2005, Encana\u2019s market value on the TSX surpassed that of long-time top dog RBC, accounting for about 5% of the S&P/TSX Composite Index. (Coincidentally, O\u2019Brien was the chair of RBC\u2019s board at the same time.)\n\nWith the city\u2019s encouragement, Encana started drawing up plans for a new office tower that would stand as a physical testament to its world-class stature. With a billion-dollar budget, Encana commissioned Foster + Partners, the elite architects behind London\u2019s Gherkin, to build its curvy new landmark on the prominent corner of Centre St. and 6th Ave. Then the tallest skyscraper in the city, the Bow would consolidate employees spread across five different buildings.\n\nBy late 2005, Encana looked invincible, and Morgan decided the time was right to hand the reins to Eresman. Not only was the outgoing CEO turning 60, it was also the 30th anniversary of AEC\u2019s public market debut. Besides, his legacy was all but assured. On the day he announced his retirement, Morgan told The Globe and Mail: \u201cYou don\u2019t put your life and your passion behind something unless you know you have the right kind of person to carry it on.\u201d\n\nWithin months, however, Morgan\u2019s former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was contemplating what the founding CEO considered unthinkable: breaking up Encana.\n\nInvestment bankers, armed with sum-of-the-parts calculations, were pitching Eresman on the idea of splitting it into two companies: one producing gas, the other drawing crude from the oil sands. So-called pure plays were becoming the new holy grail, as investors clamoured for simplicity and the ability to focus on a single commodity.\n\nMorgan was technically still in the picture\u2014he\u2019d arranged to hang around for a year as executive vice-chair to instill confidence during the transition (or at least, that\u2019s how he spun it). But there was little he could do about a potential split. \u201cOne of the great lessons in life is that when the CEO is leaving, your influence is ending,\u201d he says now.\n\nThe calls to break up Encana grew louder. Advisers salivating over the fees they could earn from negotiating the split talked up how much the two divisions could be worth separately, since investors would supposedly be better able to value each business. Morgan says he never bought the hype. \u201cIf you think about it that way,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s no way you can have a long-term vision about building a company.\u201d\n\nOutraged, he stepped down three months early, though the company made it seem to outsiders like that was always the plan. \u201cI just did not want to be involved in breaking up the company,\u201d he says. (Morgan went on to become board chair of SNC-Lavalin, where his tenure was tainted after a top executive admitted to paying bribes to Saadi Gaddafi in order to land contracts in Libya. Morgan has always said the bribes were disguised as part of normal project costs, and there was no way for board members to detect them.)\n\nThe split didn\u2019t happen immediately, however. First, Eresman flirted with turning Encana into an income trust to avoid paying corporate tax (a move Morgan also objected to). But with other heavyweights like Telus and BCE contemplating the same move, Ottawa kiboshed trusts altogether. That put the bifurcation back on Eresman\u2019s priority list.\n\nFor Encana, the goal was to make investors realize its gas potential, partly because gas was seen as more environmentally friendly than oil\u2014and far cleaner than coal. \u201cEveryone thought natural gas was the fuel of the future,\u201d says O\u2019Brien, adding the company was constantly questioned about its substantial exposure to the \u201cdirty\u201d oil sands.\n\nEresman was similarly convinced natural gas prices were bound to rise. Demand was surging, and the conventional producers couldn\u2019t keep up because their wells were generally small and dried up quickly. Encana, meanwhile, was focused on unconventional gas plays deep underground. That made its wells more expensive but also more prolific. As gas prices rose, Eresman bet Encana\u2019s technical prowess would allow it to beat its rivals by pumping more fuel at a lower cost than they could.\n\nWith the price of natural gas soaring toward US$13 per million BTU, Encana announced its split in May 2008. Management had given its oil sands unit a strong foundation to go it alone, having formed a US$15-billion joint venture with U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips that secured access to refineries in Illinois and Texas. Just four months later, however, the global financial system nearly imploded, sending both oil and gas prices plummeting. Encana\u2019s share price dropped by 55% in four months, and management was forced to focus on simply staying afloat. By late 2009, the worst was over, and 99% of Encana shareholders approved the spinoff of the oil assets into a new company, called Cenovus.\n\nThis should have been Eresman\u2019s time to shine. A native of Medicine Hat, he\u2019d joined AEC after graduating with a degree in petroleum engineering from the University of Wyoming, and he\u2019d spent his entire career under Morgan\u2019s wing. (Eresman declined to comment for this story.) Now that Encana was focused on gas extraction, he was eager to implement his growth strategy, built around an operating model dubbed \u201cthe gas factory\u201d\u2014the idea that the fuel could be produced almost as a repetitive manufacturing process.\n\nInternally, Eresman sometimes had trouble rallying the troops. Where Morgan had a knack for making employees feel like they were part of something bigger, Eresman was an introvert who hated giving presentations, but he cared deeply about his employees. \u201cHe was actually very self-aware,\u201d says McRitchie. \u201cHe talked about the different coaches he was getting for his public speaking. And he wanted to be good at what he wasn\u2019t good at.\u201d\n\nThe bigger issue for Eresman was that gas prices fell into a funk. They\u2019d clawed their way back to US$6 in January 2010, when everyone was high on the post-crisis recovery, but within two years, they\u2019d dropped to US$2, a low not seen since 2002.\n\nIn a way, Eresman had been right about unconventional gas. The old-school stuff had become problematic, and competing producers were getting more sophisticated with their technical expertise. The problem was they used these newly honed skills to tap vast quantities of so-called shale oil and gas in the United States, which never used to figure into reserve estimates. As Encana touted its gas factory, rival shale producers such as Pioneer Natural Resources and EOG Resources became masters of fracking\u2014shooting sand, water and chemicals into rock and forcing it to fracture, allowing oil or gas to escape through the cracks.\n\nFracking spread through Pennsylvania, Louisiana, the Bakken in North Dakota and the Permian Basin in Texas. The U.S. was suddenly awash in oil and gas, which spelled big trouble for Encana and many other Canadian producers because it meant their biggest export market morphed into their biggest competitor.\n\nEresman tried to expand the North American market by promoting natural gas as a less expensive transport fuel and investing in technology to make that happen. He also touted its environmental edge over gasoline and diesel. Still, the deluge of gas pushed prices down.\n\n\u201cI remember back when Encana announced they were going to double their gas production within five years,\u201d says New York\u2013based equity analyst Phil Skolnick, who is now with Eight Capital. \u201cThis was around 2010, and I actually downgraded the stock.\u201d Because plans to build liquefied natural gas plants to export the fuel abroad were still in their infancy, the newfound supply was landlocked in both Canada and the U.S. \u201cSo that scared me,\u201d Skolnick says.\n\nIt scared the market, too. Over two years, Encana\u2019s stock dropped by 52%, wiping out any gains made after the crisis.\n\nThe company started promoting its natural gas liquids\u2014condensate and commodities like propane and butane, which are byproducts of gas production. It even talked up its remaining oil production, all while trying to calm investors by reminding them it had hedged a large chunk of its natural gas output around US$6 through 2012.\n\nEresman also went hunting for joint ventures, hoping to accelerate development of Encana\u2019s reserves in the Montney Formation in northeast British Columbia while splitting the development costs. He snagged a big one: PetroChina bought half a project for $5.4 billion. At the time, Chinese interest in Canadian energy seemed limitless. But a few months later, the deal fell apart because of a disagreement on its structure.\n\nWith writedowns piling up\u2014including a US$4.7-billion impairment charge in 2012\u2014Encana finally struck a $2.9-billion joint venture with Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Corp. to develop a massive field in Western Canada. Then PetroChina came back at the end of 2012, paying $2.2 billion for a 49.9% stake in a gas project in Alberta\u2019s hot Duvernay Formation.\n\nA month later, however, Eresman was gone, effective immediately. His so-called retirement at age 54 was announced late on a Friday. The company later said he was \u201cfatigued.\u201d\n\nIn the early months of 2013, Calgary was rife with rumours about who would take the reins at Encana. The wrong boss could push the company into the hands of a foreign buyer, as had just happened with struggling oil producer Nexen Inc., which was snapped up by the Chinese.\n\nThe search for Eresman\u2019s successor was led by Clayton Woitas, an oil patch veteran and Encana director who stepped in as interim CEO. By June 2013, he and the board had decided on an oilman with no emotional attachment to Encana\u2019s history\u2014one who could deliver a badly needed shakeup.\n\nDoug Suttles wasn\u2019t well-known in Canada, but he\u2019d gained enormous profile in his previous role. As chief operating officer of BP Exploration & Production, he was the point person as BP struggled to stem the flow of crude gushing from the Macondo oil well into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.\n\nSuttles\u2019s first order of business was a four-month review to see which of Encana\u2019s assets could be kept and which could be sold off. He ended up chopping 27 operating areas down to five to accelerate the shift to oil and gas liquids. He also slashed 800 jobs\u2014about 20% of the company\u2019s workforce\u2014including several top executives; closed its office in Texas; and reduced the company\u2019s dividend by more than half. \u201cI remember early on asking him what had been the secret, if you will, to his success,\u201d says McRitchie, \u201cand he said, in a word, \u2018focus.\u2019\u201d\n\nSuttles also zeroed in on Encana\u2019s royalty-free lands as an unexploited source of cash. Woitas\u2014who\u2019d replaced O\u2019Brien as chair when Suttles took over\u2014backed the idea of a royalty division that would see Encana essentially play landlord to other drillers and harvest the rent. Woitas knew the business well, being a proprietor of a similar company himself.\n\nIn 2014, Encana announced the $1.5-billion initial public offering of PrairieSky Royalty. A few months later, Encana sold off its remaining stake for $2.6 billion. PrairieSky also bought Range Royalty LP\u2014of which Woitas was chair and CEO\u2014for $699 million. (Woitas declined to comment for this story, as did Suttles and Ovintiv.)\n\nThe changes kept coming. In the same year, Encana paid US$3.1 billion for a position in the red-hot Eagle Ford shale fields in Texas, then spent another US$5.9 billion in cash for Athlon Energy, giving it a sizable stake in the state\u2019s oil-rich Permian Basin. To cover the cost of the deals, Suttles put the PrairieSky proceeds to work, and also unloaded infrastructure assets such as gas plants and other non-core properties. The sell-off included its Jonah natural gas assets in Wyoming for US$1.8 billion; last year, the company that bought them defaulted on its debt and had to be restructured.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: The Globe and Mail\n\nIn theory, Suttles\u2019s heavy bet on oil\u2014the commodity Encana had all but abandoned five years earlier\u2014made sense. But the timing was unfortunate. In late 2014, OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia decided it was done with reducing its own output to prop up world oil prices, while other countries, notably the U.S. and Canada, pumped full out. The Saudis cranked open their taps, and the price of West Texas Intermediate oil tumbled from US$105 a barrel in June 2014 to US$53 by the start of 2015. By the end of the year, it hovered below US$40.\n\nEncana and its peers dealt with the \u201clower for longer\u201d era by slashing capital spending, laying off staff and issuing stock to keep debt ratios in check. By mid-2016, Encana\u2019s share price, which had been hammered during the worst of the oil-price rout, began to recover thanks to internal austerity, along with the company\u2019s focus on its Permian and Eagle Ford assets in the U.S. and its Montney and Duvernay plays in Canada.\n\nThat is, until late 2018, when Suttles surprised investors with the US$5.5-billion acquisition of Newfield Exploration. The deal provided an entry into what had been seen as a promising shale play in Oklahoma, but the fervour had already started to fade by the time Encana arrived. The takeover also increased Encana\u2019s debt (again) because Newfield had US$2.2 billion in net debt on its books.\n\nTo Encana\u2019s credit, the deal prompted multiple debt-rating agencies to upgrade its credit profile, expecting that the additional geographic diversification and heavier skew to oil would help its balance sheet. But many shareholders felt blindsided, and the stock tumbled by more than 12% on the day of the deal. It has yet to recover.\n\nAt the same time, Suttles\u2019s compensation was becoming an issue. From the time he took over to the end of 2020, Encana\u2019s stock lost more than 80% of its value. Yet, Suttles was paid US$92 million over the same period (though some of his shares and options have lost value as the stock price dropped).\n\nWith investors losing hope, Encana floated the idea of relocating to the U.S. Suttles had already done it himself. In March 2018, the CEO informed Encana staff he was moving to Denver, where the company had an office, citing personal reasons. Half its employees were already based in the U.S. anyway. When Encana was asked if this portended something bigger, officials were adamant a full-blown relocation wasn\u2019t in the cards. \u201cThe answer to that is, absolutely not,\u201d a spokesperson said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re a Canadian company. We\u2019re headquartered in Calgary. This decision doesn\u2019t change that in any way.\u201d\n\nA year and a half later, Suttles went for it\u2014and tacked on the name change for good measure. Executives explained that, as a Canadian-based company, Encana was missing out on much of the passive shareholding its U.S. peers were enjoying, and that put pressure on the share price. Suttles said the company\u2019s entry into a host of new stock indexes, such as the S&P MidCap 400, would mean US$1 billion in new investment as the shares got scooped up into exchange-traded funds.\n\nSome Canadian shareholders, including Letko Brosseau & Associates, which held 4% of the stock, raised a fuss, saying the company might actually lose Canadian investors. Nonetheless, shareholders approved the redomicile strategy. And Encana was no more.\n\nSo who killed Encana? Gwyn Morgan and David O\u2019Brien\u2014the company\u2019s co-founders, once like brothers\u2014are at odds.\n\n\u201cIt all comes back to the Trudeau government\u2019s policies,\u201d says Morgan, an avowed conservative who can barely say the Prime Minister\u2019s name without seething. He never quite articulates what the government could have done differently, but his argument generally suggests Liberal policies put a chill on investment dollars, sealing Encana\u2019s fate.\n\nO\u2019Brien doesn\u2019t buy it. A Montrealer and former corporate lawyer at Ogilvy Renault, he moved to Calgary in the late 1970s to become general counsel at Petro-Canada. \u201cI tend to have a more pan-Canadian view of things, as opposed to an Alberta view. And I don\u2019t think the government had anything to do with what happened to Encana, frankly,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m an investor in a couple of private oil companies, and of course the lack of market access has been an issue, but that was an issue that happened during the Conservative regime, as well.\u201d\n\nIf anything, O\u2019Brien says, government is the reason Encana had a fighting chance in the first place. When he and Morgan pitched the initial merger back in the early 2000s, they presented it as a merger of equals, with no premium paid to shareholders. It was a risky bet, particularly because a deep-pocketed foreign player could have easily picked off one or both of them. But they made their case in Ottawa, and the federal Liberals signalled the merger was off limits to foreigners.\n\nAs for the decision to turn Encana into a pure play, Morgan is adamant: If the company had kept its oil assets, \u201cEncana would still be in Canada.\u201d\n\nOnce again, O\u2019Brien isn\u2019t so sure. \u201cThat was the fatal mistake, in a sense\u2014because commodities come and commodities go, and if you\u2019re solely dependent on one, it hurts a lot.\u201d But it\u2019s only part of the story. \u201cI\u2019m not as convinced it would have made as big a change as you might think,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happened to Encana happened to most energy companies. They got hit by a very substantial revision in energy prices, both in oil and in natural gas.\u201d And it\u2019s not as though one arm has performed dramatically better than the other. \u201cCenovus has been terrible. Encana has been terrible,\u201d O\u2019Brien says.\n\nHe puts the blame on the shale revolution\u2014an unstoppable force that bowled over the industry. This was largely a technological disruption, no different than the way Facebook destroyed the ad business or Netflix killed movie rentals.\n\nOf course, O\u2019Brien is biased. He oversaw the split, whereas Morgan wanted nothing to do with it. But in Calgary, there\u2019s some sympathy for O\u2019Brien\u2019s argument, because so many gas producers have been brought to their knees. Early this year, former natural gas powerhouses Arc Resources and Seven Generations merged to weather the storm. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of it really could have been prevented,\u201d says Stacey McDonald, a former equity analyst who\u2019s now a director at gas producer Birchcliff Energy. \u201cA lot of it was a function of the massive transformational shift to horizontal drilling and the improvement in productivity from wells.\u201d\n\nThis revolution has shaken Canada\u2019s natural gas industry to its core. In 2018, the Alberta government commissioned three experts\u2014former TransCanada CEO Hal Kvisle, former Canadian Energy Pipeline Association CEO Brenda Kenny and former Husky Energy exec Terrance Kutryk\u2014to report on the future of the province\u2019s producers. Their conclusion was grim. \u201cOur dominant export market is now our primary competitor, and Western Canadian gas will struggle to retain, let alone grow, its market share within North America,\u201d the panel warned. It\u2019s a far cry from Morgan\u2019s glory days, when Canadian oil and gas was the answer to energy independence for the West.\n\nYet over the past three years, the U.S. shale industry itself has been decimated, and numerous companies have filed for bankruptcy. While the supply is monumental, the fundamentals aren\u2019t, because the wells decline so quickly. \u201cIt is so short-cycle,\u201d says Robert Fitzmartyn, an equity analyst at Stifel FirstEnergy. \u201cThirty-five to 40% of your return is captured in your first year.\u201d Drilling rights must also be negotiated with hundreds, sometimes thousands, of land owners, who grant short-term permits. In the Montney in B.C., meanwhile, \u201cyou can hold your land for far longer, on less capital invested, than in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Ovintiv is that its current structure doesn\u2019t allow for enduring a decade-long disruption. \u201cThey got seduced by the valuations of the pure play,\u201d Fitzmartyn says. He contrasts this with Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNRL), Canada\u2019s second-largest gas producer\u2014which also has substantial oil sands production. Its stock is still 28% off its 2008 peak, but the company\u2019s shares have returned to pre-COVID levels, and its dividend has increased by nearly 20% annually when compounded over 13 years.\n\n\u201cCanadian Natural was chasing us all the time,\u201d Morgan says of Encana\u2019s rival, headed by billionaire Murray Edwards. CNRL has been \u201cbattered and beat up but still came out relatively well, and I admire them for that. They are now the flagship Canadian company. And I\u2019m glad somebody has at least picked up the flag.\u201d\n\nOwning oil assets isn\u2019t the only way Encana could have diversified. The company also used to own pipelines, along with storage and gas plants, but sold those assets over many years for short-term financial gains. In-house, these assets might only generate returns of six to eight times annual cash flow, yet they can sell for 12 times cash flow\u2014money that can be used to fund more gas production. McRitchie argues the straight math is too simplistic. \u201cWhat are the intangibles, the insights you get from having that integrated business?\u201d He also notes infrastructure assets are now some of the hottest in the entire energy sector. \u201cThey\u2019ve become the dominant businesses,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they\u2019ve built and created this power over the exploration and production companies.\u201d\n\nHaving these operations in-house helps a company control how much it drills. By owning refineries or pipelines, it isn\u2019t wedded to long-term external contracts to supply oil or gas. Chasing these benefits, Cenovus announced a deal this past October to buy Husky Energy, adding sizable oil-refining capacity in Canada and the U.S., plus offshore operations off Canada\u2019s east coast and in the South China Sea, as well as a network of gas stations.\n\nAs for the future of the company formerly known as Encana, in March Ovintiv sold its Eagle Ford assets\u2014the ones Suttles spent US$3.1 billion to acquire in 2014\u2014for US$880 million. Just a few weeks earlier, it let go of its Duvernay holdings in Alberta for US$263 million, cutting one more thread to Canada. Ovintiv\u2019s stock has rallied in the past six months, but it\u2019s coming off an abysmal low; at the end of March, the shares were worth less than a quarter of what they were trading for during the global financial crisis. Suttles has pledged to slash debt, and the company has promised to update its compensation policies following pressure from an activist investor.\n\nLooking back now, splitting up may have been Encana\u2019s original sin, but there\u2019s no single culprit for its demise. Many of the worst decisions made by its leaders were arguably executed with the best of intentions, like Eresman\u2019s bet on natural gas as a way to get ahead on sustainability. But the executives could only control so much. \u201cThe world changed dramatically around us,\u201d says McRitchie, reflecting on Encana\u2019s wild ride. The same could just as well happen to the new crop of clean energy companies that look unstoppable today. \u201cYour strategy needs to be live,\u201d he warns, \u201cnot entrenched.\u201d\n\nAs for Morgan, he\u2019s made some peace with the unravelling. \u201cI knew they were ultimately going to go to the U.S.,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019ve always said: If you want to have your company move, make sure you hire an American CEO. The writing was on the wall.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s still something he\u2019ll never get over, something so personal he just can\u2019t shake: \u201cWhy would they get rid of the Encana name?\u201d\n\nYour time is valuable.
