Select updates have been made incorporating first nine-month actuals, timing of remaining drilling for the calendar year and adjustments due to cost inflation.\n\nNew wells put onstream in late October are delivering strong performance above budget expectations. However, timing of the new well tie-ins resulted in Kiwetinohk not realizing this new production during the quarter. Estimates for capital and production for the year remain on track.\n\nThe Company added one spud in the Placid Montney area in 2022. Kiwetinohk anticipates a net reduction of three wells spud in 2022 as four Simonette Duvernay wells are now scheduled to spud in January versus December 2022. Deferred capital is offset through pre-investment into planned 2023 activity.\n\nOperating costs improved less than expected in the quarter due to the timing of the new production, workovers and in-field inflation. Operating cost guidance increased to $10.00-$11.00/boe for the year.\n\nTransportation costs were higher quarter-over-quarter due to a higher portion of natural gas production being shipped to Chicago on the Alliance Pipeline. Kiwetinohk expects to continue shipping approximately 90% of its natural gas production on the Alliance Pipeline in the fourth quarter and has tightened transportation guidance to $5.50-$6.00/boe for the year.\n\nManagement is preparing the 2023 budget and operating plans and expects to release 2023 guidance in mid-December 2022.\n\n2022 financial & operational guidance\n\n\n\nRevised\n\nRevised Original\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 10,\n\n2022,\n\nAugust 22,\n\n2022, January 12, 2022,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction (2022 average) 1 Mboe/d\n\n16.0 - 18.0\n\n16 - 18.0 13.0 - 15.0 Oil & liquids Mbbl/d\n\n8.00 - 8.80\n\n8.00 - 8.80 6.50 - 7.50 Natural gas MMcf/d\n\n48.0 \u2013 55.2\n\n48.0 \u2013 55.2 39 - 45 Production by market 2 %\n\n100 %\n\n100 % 100 % Chicago %\n\n80% - 85%\n\n80% - 85% 87% - 97% AECO %\n\n15% - 20%\n\n15% - 20% 3% - 13% Financial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyalty rate %\n\n10% - 12%\n\n10% - 12% 12% - 15% Operating costs $/boe\n\n$10.00-$11.00\n\n$8.25 - $9.00 $7.50 - $8.50 Transportation $/boe\n\n$5.50 - $6.00\n\n$5.00 - $6.00 $5.00 - $6.00 Corporate G&A expense 3 $MM\n\n$18 - $20\n\n$18 - $20 $15 - $18 Cash taxes 4 $MM\n\n$0 $0 $0\n\nCapital guidance $MM\n\n290 - 310\n\n290 - 310 210 - 240 Upstream $MM\n\n275 - 290\n\n275 - 290 200 - 220 Green Energy $MM\n\n15 - 20\n\n15 - 20 10 - 20 Drilling - Fox Creek wells\n\n13\n\n16 11 Duvernay wells\n\n11\n\n15 10 Montney wells\n\n2\n\n1 1 2022 Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations\n\nsensitivities 5,6,7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS$70/bbl WTI & US$4.50/MMBtu HH $MM\n\n$220 - $235\n\n$230 - $255 $145 - $155 US$80/bbl WTI & US$5.00/MMBtu HH $MM\n\n$225 - $240\n\n$240 - $265 $165 - $175 2022 Net debt to Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations\n\nsensitivities 5,6,7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS$70/bbl WTI & US$4.50/MMBtu HH X\n\n0.7x\n\n0.7x 1.0x US$80/bbl WTI & US$5.00/MMBtu HH X\n\n0.6x\n\n0.6x 0.7x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 \u2013 Production and cash operating costs include scheduled Fox Creek plant turnarounds. 2 \u2013 Chicago sales of ~90% expected for rest of year. 3 \u2013 Includes G&A expenses for all divisions of the Company \u2013 Corporate, Upstream, Green Energy (power & hydrogen) and Business Development. 4 \u2013 Strip pricing as of October 10, 2022.

Previously announced guidance has not been adjusted to reflect revised pricing. 7 \u2013 The November 10, 2022 guidance used Q3/22 actual prices with US$80/Bbl WTI flat; US$5.00/MMBtu HH flat; US$0.75/CAD flat thereafter for remainder of 2022. Previously announced guidance has not been adjusted to reflect revised pricing.\n\nUpstream operational results\n\nKiwetinohk tied-in six new wells in late October, which are experiencing strong initial production rates in the early stages of flowing back in early November. The 4-34 pad at Simonette (4 wells) experienced individual well rates between 10-12 MMcf/d with an additional 1,200-1,500 b/d of condensate flowing through test facilities while completing permanent ties-ins. Early-stage production per well from the two-well pad at Tony Creek/North Simonette is averaging between 2.0-2.5 MMcf/d and approximately 1,200 bbl/d of condensate. The northern part of the field is shallower, lower pressure, more liquids rich and lower cost compared to the southern part of the Simonette field.\n\nProduction for the third quarter and the first nine months averaged 16,487 boe/d and 15,529 boe/d respectively. Third quarter production was relatively flat (-2%) quarter-over-quarter due to strong base production and a small contribution of volumes from the September 15 closing of the Placid Montney asset consolidation. Last quarter, management guided toward improved operating costs during the second half of the year, which was partially realized. Operating costs of $11.13/boe were 8% lower than the second quarter but higher than planned.\n\nKiwetinohk is currently drilling three additional wells on the 4-34 pad planned for completion early in 2023.\n\nThe Company updated its Placid drilling program to increase the number of Montney wells to spud in 2022 consistent with previously stated plans to accelerate Montney development upon completion of the asset consolidation.\n\nThe Board of Directors has sanctioned two Simonette gas plant expansions to add approximately 40% capacity that will be available in late 2023 at an estimated cost of $45-$55 million.\n\nGreen Energy development results\n\nKiwetinohk continued to advance its solar and gas-fired power projects in the AESO queue and added a second natural gas-fired 'firm renewable' development project into the AESO process bringing its total power project development portfolio to 2,150 MW.\n\nBased on discussions with Alberta regulatory bodies subsequent to quarter end, Kiwetinohk has been advised that the regulatory process review for the Homestead Solar project to receive transmission approval should be deferred by approximately six months from the previously announced schedule. Kiwetinohk's understanding is the regulatory process delay is the result of significant congestion of proposed power projects in the competitive Alberta power market, which is not unique to Homestead or the Company's project portfolio. Based on the Homestead regulatory process experience, and Kiwetinohk's financial risk management processes, management is proactively adjusting development project timing across its solar and firm renewable project portfolio by three-to-six months.\n\nThe adjustments being made to anticipated project schedules are based on current approval time frames being experienced in the current Alberta regulatory environment. Other potential risks to our project timeline include but are not limited to additional regulatory backlogs, potential stakeholder concerns raised during the regulatory process, availability of materials and labor, etc., which have not been considered in the project schedule.\n\nHomestead Solar Power Project\n\nOn September 22, 2022, the 400-MW Homestead Solar power plant received AUC power plant approval. AUC transmission application preparation is advancing, including ongoing consultation and engagement with the community. Anticipated AUC transmission approval and FID now expected in Q4 2023. Kiwetinohk continues to evaluate engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) bids for Homestead and to discuss financing options with potential strategic partners.\n\nAccordingly, for Homestead Solar, Kiwetinohk expects:\n\nEarliest FID of Q4 2023\n\nEarliest commercial operations date (COD) of Q4 2025\n\nOpal Firm Renewable Project\n\nThe 101 MW Opal Firm Renewable project received AUC power plant approval on August 3, 2022, secured land in September 2022 and awaiting Alberta Environment and Protected Areas approval. Once EPC pricing discussions are more advanced with selected vendors Kiwetinohk will update its Opal capital cost estimate.\n\nAccordingly, for Opal Firm Renewable, Kiwetinohk expects:\n\nEarliest FID of Q4 2023\n\nEarliest COD of Q4 2025\n\nGranum Solar Power Project and Phoenix Solar Power Project\n\nKiwetinohk continued to progress its 350 MW Granum Solar (Granum) and 170 MW Phoenix Solar (Phoenix) projects through environmental reviews and AESO processes during the quarter. Granum entered AESO Stage 2 on August 2, 2022 and Phoenix began environmental studies and stakeholder consultations. Kiwetinohk increased the capacity of Granum to 350 MW (from 300 MW) and Phoenix to 170 MW (from 150 MW) following project optimization and evaluation of potential transmission capacity.\n\nBased on Homestead Project regulatory process experience, the Company expects\n\nEarliest FID of Q2 2024 for Granum and Q1 2024 for Phoenix\n\nand Q1 2024 for Earliest COD of Q2 2026 for Granum and Q3 2025 for Phoenix\n\nDevelopment of Kiwetinohk's Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) 1 and NGCC 2 projects advanced with pre-FEED (front end engineering and design) analysis, CCUS evaluation and preliminary environmental scoping.\n\nCarbon storage hubs\n\nOn October 4, 2022, the Government of Alberta awarded Kiwetinohk the right to advance planning on the Opal Carbon Hub and NGCC 2 Carbon Hub projects, representing up to an estimated 4 million tonnes/year of sequestration capacity. The next step in the process is to execute an evaluation agreement with the Province of Alberta for both projects, under which Kiwetinohk will be granted the right to conduct evaluations and testing of deep subsurface reservoirs, over a term not to exceed five years, for the purpose of determining their suitability for use for the sequestration of captured carbon dioxide.\n\nKiwetinohk's long term strategy is to capture 90% or more of the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) associated with the Company's planned gas-fired power projects. The Company believes its Opal and NGCC 2 power projects associated with the carbon hubs it has been granted, become incrementally de-risked as Kiwetinohk will have control of the development timeline for its power projects and significant influence on the associated carbon hubs. In addition, the Company would be a manager of access to the carbon hubs for Kiwetinohk's associated power projects and other industrial players.\n\nAs part of its commercial assessment of the carbon hubs, Kiwetinohk will also begin work to determine how to offer capture, transportation and sequestration services to other CO 2 emitters and the terms of such offerings. The commercial assessment will also provide an opportunity to work with government and industry to establish a provincial CO 2 midstream policy.\n\nKiwetinohk believes it will be well positioned as a primary user of its awarded carbon hubs due to its associated power projects in development today and potential future projects. The development of the carbon hubs will also provide an opportunity for third party revenue streams, for processing and sequestration capacity, as other regional players seek to reduce their carbon emissions footprint.\n\nThe carbon hubs that Kiwetinohk were awarded are part of the corporate development plans for the gas-fired power portfolio and have not required any incremental capital or G&A commitments at this time.\n\nFinancial results\n\nAdjusted funds flow from operations was $49.3 million, or $1.10/share (diluted), in the quarter. This was down from the second quarter, primarily due to lower liquids pricing, hedging losses and higher total royalty payments partially offset by net commodity sales from purchases. Free adjusted funds flow from operations1 was a deficit of $11.1 million (before acquisitions) due to significant investments in drilling and completion activity in the quarter.\n\nRoyalty payments increased to $18.9 million in the quarter due to C-star (C*) payout on earlier wells and full receipt of the Company's 2021 gas cost allowance in the second quarter which significantly lowered second quarter royalties.\n\nOperating costs of $11.13/boe showed an 8% improvement from the second quarter, but were higher than guidance due to the timing of new production additions, updates to operating cost forecast for workovers, other costs to optimize production and inflation.\n\nNet debt increased to $125.3 million, primarily because of the $59.2 million consolidation of Placid working interests late in the third quarter. Available credit facility capacity2 was $245.8 million at September 30, 2022. Net debt to annualized adjusted funds flow from operations1 of 0.65x at quarter end continues to be below the corporate target ceiling of 1.0x. Subsequent to quarter end, Kiwetinohk completed the semi-annual redetermination on the Credit Facility with no change to the borrowing base of $375 million.\n\n_________________________ 1 Non-GAAP measure that does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities.

The report details Kiwetinohk's energy transition business strategy, focus on stakeholder and Indigenous inclusion through its 'Prime Directive' and covers the Company's focus on five priority ESG topics: climate change, health and safety, land and biodiversity, community and Indigenous inclusion, and inclusion, equity and diversity.\n\nIn Q4 2021, Kiwetinohk's production was on average 36% lower in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) than the Canadian natural gas and conventional oil averages for 2020 (scope 1 intensity per BOE). Methane reduction initiatives in 2022 are expected to further improve the company's scope 1 emissions performance. Approved expansions at the Simonette 5-31 plant to include full electrification, and planning for grid connection to the Simonette 10-29 plant, will deliver additional GHG reductions when completed.\n\nAs Kiwetinohk delivers its low- and zero-emissions Green Energy power, it is assessing opportunities to address scope 2 emissions, while addressing scope 3 emissions over the longer term through vertical integration into power and utilities, combined with CCUS.\n\nThe Company made significant progress in advancing its unified health and safety program in 2022, further to consolidation with Distinction Energy. Land management and biodiversity is also a key factor in Kiwetinohk's success with the Company spending more than 5x the Alberta Energy Regulator's mandatory minimum spend on asset retirement obligations (ARO). Kiwetinohk's asset retirement financial planning methodology is designed to ensure proactive funding for assets across their lifecycle through active phase funding for future retirement. This approach anticipates Alberta Energy Regulator requirements for increased asset retirement spending and demonstrates our commitment to environmental performance and maintaining financial resiliency through end-of-life asset management\n\nKiwetinohk continues to engage with Indigenous people on whose traditional land it operates, working to develop economic and employment opportunities and supporting cultural initiatives. In 2022, Kiwetinohk partnered with Indian Business Corporation to provide new loans to Indigenous entrepreneurs seeking to grow their businesses. The Company also launched an Indigenous operator trainee program with its first students already employed. The Company continues to work with Indigenous people from across Alberta and across Canada with respect to the Company's name, which means \"north\" or \"northward\" in Cree, a widely spoken Indigenous language.\n\nGovernance highlights include strong board independence, sector experience and diversity, including 33% female representation and 22% of the board identifying as Black, Indigenous or People of Color, with comprehensive policies for the board and company aligned to best practices. Senior executive team members include 30% women.\n\nKiwetinohk's first diversity survey had an almost 100% response rate and revealed strong diversity, including:\n\n4% of people identify as Indigenous, including First Nations and M\u00e9tis heritage.\n\n32% female employees / 65% male employees.\n\nNon-binary and two-spirited representation.\n\n12 different ethnicities.\n\n8% identify as having a disability.\n\nPeople who are part of the 2SLGBTQ+ community\n\nKiwetinohk continues to assess its ESG performance, including the opportunity to set targets in key performance areas. Further information can be found on Kiwetinohk's web site at kiwetinohk.com/esg\n\nConference call\n\nManagement of Kiwetinohk will host a conference call on November 10, 2022, at 8 AM MT (10 AM ET) to discuss results and answer questions.\n\nParticipants will be able to listen to the conference call by dialing 1-888-204-4368 (North America toll free) or 1-647-484-0475 (Toronto and area). A replay of the call will be available until November 17, 2022, at 1-888-390-0541 (North America toll free) or 416-764-8677 (Toronto and area) by using the code 690603.\n\nAbout Kiwetinohk\n\nWe, at Kiwetinohk, are passionate about addressing climate change and the future of energy. Kiwetinohk's mission is to build a profitable energy transition business providing clean, reliable, dispatchable, affordable energy. Kiwetinohk develops and produces natural gas and related products and is in the process of developing renewable power, natural gas-fired power, carbon capture and hydrogen clean energy projects. We view climate change with a sense of urgency, and we want to make a difference.\n\nKiwetinohk's common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol KEC.\n\nAdditional details are available within the year-end documents available on Kiwetinohk's website at www.kiwetinohk.com and SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\n\nOil and Gas Advisories\n\nFor the purpose of calculating unit costs, natural gas is converted to a barrel of oil equivalent using six thousand cubic feet of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil unless otherwise stated. The term barrel of oil equivalent (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio for gas of 6 Mcf:1 boe is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.\n\nForward looking information\n\nCertain information set forth in this news release contains forward-looking information and statements including, without limitation, management's business strategy, management's assessment of future plans and operations.

            "article_text": "CALGARY, AB, Nov. 8, 2023 /CNW/ - Kiwetinohk Energy Corp. (TSX: KEC) today reported its 2023 third quarter financial and operational results. As companion documents to this news release, please review the Company's management discussion and analysis (MD&A) and condensed consolidated interim financial statements (available on kiwetinohk.com or www.sedarplus.ca ) for additional financial and operational details.\n\nMessage to shareholders\n\n\"Kiwetinohk continues to focus on building a highly profitable upstream oil and gas business as a foundation for its leading energy transition business,\" said Pat Carlson, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"In the third quarter, our upstream division, under the leadership of Mike Backus, made significant strides as Kiwetinohk expanded gas processing infrastructure to support future production growth. The previously announced 30 MMcf/d expansion of the Simonette 10-29 gas plant was completed ahead of schedule, providing Kiwetinohk a pathway to grow production to 40,000 boe/d by drilling within currently owned leases. Two new wells in our oil-weighted Tony Creek development area successfully came online in September contributing to strong production in the quarter and we are currently completing a four well pad in our core Duvernay land to finish up the calendar year. As we approach the conclusion of our first two years of development of our upstream assets, I am pleased to note we now own about one-third of the top 100 (first year production) and 7 of the top 10 producing Duvernay wells in Alberta with Kiwetinohk having drilled 4 of these 7.\n\n\"In our power business, we achieved a major milestone by executing an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with PCL Construction (PCL) for our Homestead solar project. We also progressed Homestead to Stage 4 of the Alberta Electrical System Operator's (AESO) regulatory process. In addition, we received confirmation during the quarter that all seven of our currently announced power development projects will not be subjected to the AESO's new cluster study review process. This provides an elevated level of regulatory predictability for our significant power development portfolio in Alberta. As we approach the end of the year, the power business, under the direction of Fareen Sunderji, will focus activities on the Homestead solar and the Opal peaker plant projects, which are currently the most advanced and highest priority opportunities in our power portfolio. While Kiwetinohk awaits further regulatory clarity from both the federal and provincial governments, we continue to maintain and optimize expenditures while advancing development of one of Alberta's largest greenfield development portfolios which has resiliency to both regulatory environments.\n\n\"Kiwetinohk is committed to the belief that all projects within its power portfolio could play a crucial role in supporting Alberta's successful transition to clean energy. Our projects are designed to use leading proven equipment expected to provide a competitive advantage in the Alberta power market. If constructed, the Company believes the portfolio will contribute to more efficient and cleaner power generation while supporting industry and government goals for stable and sustainable power supply, with reduced energy costs for Albertans. Through its project portfolio, which has taken multiple years of expertise and less than $40 million of capital and general & administrative expenditures to develop, we are uniquely positioned to be able to deliver additional value to shareholders.\n\n\"Being an early mover in the energy transition enabled Kiwetinohk to capture attractive opportunities in the upstream and power business many of which cannot be recreated in the current environment. As a result, our opportunities far exceed our ability to finance the entire portfolio. The best thing to do is to sell interests or entire projects to finance remaining projects and maximize shareholder value.\"\n\nFinancial and operating statistics for the quarter\n\n\n\nQ3 2023 Q3 2022 YTD 2023 YTD 2022 Production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOil & condensate (bbl/d) 6,367 5,558 6,770 5,446 NGLs (bbl/d) 2,765 1,944 2,520 1,793 Natural gas (Mcf/d) 72,518 53,912 75,492 49,741 Total (boe/d) 21,218 16,487 21,872 15,529 Oil and condensate % of production 30 % 34 % 31 % 35 % NGL % of production 13 % 12 % 11 % 12 % Natural gas % of production 57 % 54 % 58 % 53 % Realized prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOil & condensate ($/bbl) 100.05 114.48 97.43 121.48 NGLs ($/bbl) 48.21 75.50 53.84 76.68 Natural gas ($/Mcf) 3.53 10.20 3.92 9.01 Total ($/boe) 48.38 80.86 49.87 80.31 Royalty expense ($/boe) (2.75) (12.51) (4.68) (7.34) Operating expenses ($/boe) (9.17) (11.13) (8.51) (11.04) Transportation expenses ($/boe) (5.59) (6.63) (5.65) (5.34) Operating netback 1 ($/boe) 30.87 50.59 31.03 56.59 Realized gain (loss) on risk management ($/boe) 2 1.23 (19.41) 1.97 (16.96) Realized gain (loss) on risk management - purchases ($/boe) 2 1.59 (16.92) 1.88 (6.77) Net commodity sales from purchases (loss) ($/boe) 1 (1.22) 21.64 (0.92) 9.18 Adjusted operating netback 1 32.47 35.90 33.96 42.04 Financial results ($000s, except per share amounts)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity sales from production 94,432 122,644 297,788 340,441 Net commodity sales from purchases (loss) 1 (2,376) 32,813 (5,490) 38,895 Cash flow from operating activities 60,294 91,710 181,814 155,822 Adjusted funds flow from operations 1 55,314 49,342 177,614 162,576 Per share basic 1.26 1.12 4.03 3.69 Per share diluted 1.25 1.10 3.99 3.65 Net debt to annualized adjusted funds flow from operations 1 0.67 0.65 0.67 0.65 Free funds flow deficiency from operations (excluding acquisitions/dispositions) 1 (7,827) (11,119) (52,961) (4,445) Net (loss) income (12,056) 55,379 63,594 75,681 Per share basic (0.27) 1.26 1.44 1.72 Per share diluted (0.27) 1.24 1.43 1.70 Capital expenditures prior to (dispositions) acquisitions 1 63,141 60,461 230,575 167,021 Net (dispositions) acquisitions (1,645) 59,181 (1,995) 57,323 Capital expenditures and net (dispositions) acquisitions 1 61,496 119,642 228,580 224,344\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance sheet ($000s, except share amounts)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal assets 1,028,176 837,349 1,028,176 837,349 Long-term liabilities 279,402 214,536 279,402 214,536 Net debt 1 187,517 125,263 187,517 125,263 Adjusted working capital (deficit) surplus 1 (8,240) (24,065) (8,240) (24,065) Weighted average shares outstanding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic 43,884,942 44,114,105 44,058,853 44,004,315 Diluted 44,389,687 44,795,079 44,554,647 44,491,336 Shares outstanding end of period 43,785,925 44,117,187 43,785,925 44,117,187\n\n1 \u2013 Non-GAAP and other financial measure that does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities.

Available credit facility capacity1 was 46% of the $375.0 million borrowing base or $171.9 million at September 30, 2023 . Kiwetinohk used a separate facility provided by Export Development Canada (EDC) to post letters of credit for $51.7 million to backstop Generating Unit Owners Contributions (GUOC) payments required to advance the power portfolio. In doing so, the Company met all conditions required to ensure the entire portfolio was not subject to the new AESO cluster study approval process. At September 30, 2023 the Company had $8.9 million of available LC capacity under the EDC facility.\n\nUpstream operational results\n\nProduction for the third quarter of 2023 averaged 21,218 boe/d, about 800 boe/d higher than the previous quarter. New production that came on-stream from a two-well pad in Simonette at the end of the quarter made only a modest impact to average production in the third quarter but will make a meaningful contribution going forward. Initial well results are slightly ahead of expectations, with production from each well of approximately 1 MMcf/d of natural gas and 900-1,000 bbls/d of condensate. During the third quarter of 2023 Kiwetinohk derived 43% of its production from liquids (30% oil and condensate and 13% NGLs) with the Company focusing its liquids marketing efforts on extracting maximum value from the Alberta market.\n\nKiwetinohk spent $60.1 million of upstream capital during the third quarter, bringing year to date investment to $221.9 million. Spending during the third quarter was focused on:\n\nDCET expenditures of $41 million comprised of the completion and tie-in of the two-well 11-24 Duvernay pad and the drilling of its four-well Duvernay pad at 14-29.\n\nof comprised of the completion and tie-in of the two-well 11-24 Duvernay pad and the drilling of its four-well Duvernay pad at 14-29. Simonette gas plant expansions on the Simonette 10-29 facility which underwent a temporary shutdown to initiate construction of the 30 MMcf/d expansion, including two additional compressors which are now commissioned. Other spending in the quarter was on additional infrastructure, and included pipeline, lease and road construction.\n\nUpstream activity in the fourth quarter remains steady with drilling ongoing on the 8-23 Simonette pad where three Duvernay wells are underway with plans to complete and bring them on-stream in Q1 2024. Completion activities are well advanced on the current 14-29 Simonette pad where four Duvernay wells are expected to come on production in the coming weeks. The drilling rig will move to the next Simonette Duvernay pad toward the end of the year, with associated spending largely part of the 2024 development program.\n\nOn November 1, 2023 the Company disposed of non-core assets in the Rimbey area for estimated proceeds of $17.6 million subsequent to closing adjustments, above the estimated proved developed reserves net present value at forward strip pricing. The Rimbey assets were not considered core to Kiwetinohk's upstream strategy and were under-capitalized within the portfolio as the Company is focused on the long-term development of its liquids-rich Simonette and Placid assets. They represented less than 1% of total proved plus probable reserves as at December 31, 2022 and contributed approximately 1% of corporate production in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nPower update\n\nCapital spending and optimization during the third quarter of 2023, totaled $3.0 million across all power projects, bringing year to date investment to $8.7 million as of September 30, 2023. Power project development is currently being managed to focus development expenditures primarily on the Homestead and Opal projects, which are the most advanced and currently considered the highest priority.\n\nKiwetinohk is also actively deferring expenditures on the remaining power projects within its development project portfolio, where possible, as it awaits further clarity from provincial and federal governments on pending electricity regulations. However, the Company expects to continue to incur costs required to maintain the competitive position of all its projects within the AESO queue.\n\nRenewable energy regulatory developments were announced by the Alberta government on August 3, 2023, directing the AUC to pause approvals of new renewable electricity projects until February 29, 2024. Kiwetinohk's Homestead solar project has already received AUC power plant approval and is unaffected by this pause. In addition, the Company understands, based on disclosure from the regulator, the AUC will continue to review power plant applications as they are filed and Kiwetinohk will continue with planned submissions of power plant applications during the pause period for Phoenix and Granum solar.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Kiwetinohk received confirmation that none of the projects in its power portfolio are affected by the new AESO cluster study assessment process thereby enhancing regulatory clarity for the Company's projects. Multiple power projects have been cancelled from the AESO's Connection Project List following the introduction of the cluster study assessment process. Kiwetinohk continues to advance its significant development portfolio and remains competitively well positioned within the Alberta market.\n\nHomestead solar project's regulatory approval has advanced to Stage 4 of the AESO process. The transmission line approval is expected to require an AUC hearing which has resulted in the delay of an earliest FID to the second half of 2024. Kiwetinohk, working with PCL, has continued to optimize the design and development plan for Homestead resulting in estimated savings of $25.0 million when compared to previous capital cost estimates. Capital costs for this project are now estimated at $725.0 million. The Company exercised land lease options on its Homestead project to secure its position for future development and retains the ability to terminate these leases upon providing notice to landowners and satisfaction of certain reclamation requirements.\n\nOpal firm renewable project continues to advance detailed engineering and is currently in Stage 3 of the AESO regulatory review process. The Company has delayed the earliest FID for Opal to the second half of 2024 as it awaits transmission line approval and continues to review and assess the implications of the Federal Government's draft Clean Electricity Regulation.\n\nKiwetinohk is not in a position to update FID and COD dates on further dated projects until clarity is provided on pending electricity regulations from provincial and federal governments and regulators.\n\nSustainability update\n\nKiwetinohk today released its 2023 Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Report (for the 2022 reporting year) in alignment with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board requirements. Highlights include a target to reduce vented methane emissions by 50% by 2025, Kiwetinohk's goal to eliminate inactive asset retirement obligations within 5 to 7 years, and its $2.8 million commitment to Little Smoky Caribou habitat rehabilitation.\n\nThis year's report includes climate scenario analysis to better asses the opportunities and challenges arising from Kiwetinohk's energy transition business model depending on how energy transition unfolds. The Company's goal is to maximize its resiliency to energy transition by exposing Kiwetinohk to increasing power prices while reducing GHG emissions associated with its natural gas production and its large electric generation facilities through deployment of new, more efficient technology and development of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) facilities. Kiwetinohk is already significant solar power developer with projects aggregating about one gigawatt of generation capacity in its current portfolio.\n\nAs Kiwetinohk advances its portfolio of natural gas-fired and solar renewable electrical generation projects, and its two CCS hubs, the Company will continue to evolve its ESG reporting in line with international ESG and sustainability accounting frameworks.\n\nConference call and 2023 annual reporting date\n\nKiwetinohk management will host a conference call on November 9, 2023, at 8 AM MT (10 AM ET) to discuss results and answer questions. Participants will be able to listen to the conference call by dialing 1-888-664-6383 (North America toll free) or 416-764-8650 (Toronto and area). A replay of the call will be available until November 16, 2023, at 1-888-390-0541 (North America toll free) or 416-764-8677 (Toronto and area) by using the code 135965.\n\nKiwetinohk plans to release its fourth quarter 2023 results prior to TSX opening on March 7, 2024.\n\nAbout Kiwetinohk\n\nWe, at Kiwetinohk, are passionate about addressing climate change and the future of energy. Kiwetinohk's mission is to build a profitable energy transition business providing clean, reliable, dispatchable, affordable energy. Kiwetinohk develops and produces natural gas and related products and is in the process of developing renewable power, natural gas-fired power, carbon capture and hydrogen clean energy projects.

Additional details are available within the year-end documents available on Kiwetinohk's website at kiwetinohk.com and SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca .\n\nOil and gas advisories\n\nFor the purpose of calculating unit costs, natural gas is converted to a barrel of oil equivalent using six thousand cubic feet of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil unless otherwise stated. The term barrel of oil equivalent (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio for gas of 6 Mcf:1 boe is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.\n\nThis news release includes references to sales volumes of \"Oils and condensate\", \"NGLs\" and \"Natural gas\" and revenues therefrom. National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, includes condensate within the NGLs product type. The Company has disclosed condensate as combined with crude oil and separately from other NGLs since the price of condensate as compared to other NGLs is currently significantly higher, and the Company believes that this crude oil and condensate presentation provides a more accurate description of its operations and results therefrom. Crude oil therefore refers to light oil, medium oil, tight oil, and condensate. NGLs refers to ethane, propane, butane, and pentane combined. Natural gas refers to conventional natural gas and shale gas combined.\n\nForward looking information\n\nCertain information set forth in this news release contains forward-looking information and statements including, without limitation, management's business strategy, management's assessment of future plans and operations.

            "article_text": "Dave Collyer, former president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), which lobbies on behalf of oil and gas companies, was appointed last week along with four others to the environmental, social and governance (ESG) advisory council of the agency tasked with providing financing and connecting Canadian companies to international markets.\n\nA former top oil and gas lobbyist has been chosen by Export Development Canada (EDC) as a sustainable investment adviser as the Crown corporation attempts to align its financing with a climate-safe future.\n\n\u201cThese enhancements to the council are a key part of how we\u2019re strengthening our ESG governance as we work to integrate ESG into everything we do and position Canadian companies for success through strong sustainability practices,\u201d said EDC president Mairead Lavery in a statement.\n\nCollyer led CAPP for six years between 2008 and 2014. Before that, he spent three decades with Shell, eventually working his way up to president of the multinational\u2019s Canadian arm.\n\n\u201cIt's kind of like inviting your foxes to advise you on chicken coop design... Why would you be reaching in that direction?\" Matt Price with @investors4paris says of a former CAPP boss advising on ESG.\n\nToday, he is board chair of Emissions Reduction Alberta, and also serves on the boards of AltaLink and ARC Resources.\n\nHis decades-long career in the oil and gas business won him a spot in the Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame, where he is applauded for \u201cspearheading a cultural shift for Canadian oil and gas executives and workers.\u201d\n\nEDC declined to make Collyer available for an interview, but told Canada\u2019s National Observer he was \u201cselected due to his extensive experience in the oil and gas sector, specifically his leadership in the industry\u2019s shift toward focusing on environmental performance and transition.\u201d\n\nCollyer\u2019s appointment is raising eyebrows among climate advocates, who question why someone who has spent their life advocating for fossil fuel extraction should be advising EDC on sustainable finance.\n\n\u201cIt's kind of like inviting your foxes to advise you on chicken coop design,\u201d director of corporate engagement with shareholder advocacy group Investor for Paris Compliance Matt Price told Canada\u2019s National Observer. \u201cWhy would you be reaching in that direction?\u201d\n\nHowever, Collyer has his admirers, too, some of whom say he believes climate change is a problem that oil and gas companies must help address.\n\nChairman of the Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame Bill Whitelaw said a large part of the cultural shift Collyer led was getting oil and gas companies to think more about the environment than they previously had.\n\n\u201cHe was the one who said to the CAPP members, 'You've got to think a lot more carefully about how we treat this planet,'\u201d Whitelaw said.\n\n\u201cHis impact in that whole sustainability, energy transition, evolution, transformation \u2014 pick your noun \u2014 it's been pretty profound.\u201d\n\nWhitelaw said Collyer recognized the industry needed to change how it presented itself to Canadians after environmentalists in the mid-2000s were eroding the sector\u2019s social license. Collyer was behind CAPP\u2019s communication strategy to reform the industry\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cThe industry was always fumbling around on trying to figure out how do we effectively communicate and engage with Canadians and let them know the industry is doing some pretty good things in terms of our environmental performance,\u201d Whitelaw said.\n\nCollyer \u201cmoved communications from a functional mechanism within CAPP to a strategic mechanism, and so all of a sudden, the VP of communications was at the leadership table guiding strategic discussions,\u201d he added.\n\nThat\u2019s not how environmental activist Tzeporah Berman, who previously co-chaired an oilsands advisory group with Collyer and Melody Lepine from the Mikisew Cree First Nation, sees it. Since 1990, the oil and gas industry has thrived, and its emissions have grown 87 per cent and are now more than a quarter of the country\u2019s total emissions.\n\nBerman, now an international program manager with Stand.earth and director of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty initiative, grants Collyer pushed the industry to recognize climate change as a threat and in some ways helped \u201cstamp out climate denial.\u201d But \u201cin my opinion, what he did is move the industry and the country from denial to delusion; that we could depend on technological fixes while continuing to expand polluting fossil fuels,\u201d she said.\n\nBerman told Canada\u2019s National Observer she\u2019s worked with Collyer on and off for years and considers him intelligent and respectful, but nonetheless finds his appointment to EDC \u201cconcerning\u201d given his focus on reducing emission intensity, rather than absolute emissions.\n\n\u201cDave, like many of his colleagues from the oil industry, is working to try and ensure that the oil and gas industry can continue to expand,\u201d she said. Collyer\u2019s vision for the industry, she said, was \u201cto decouple emissions from production\u201d so that more fossil fuels could be extracted without adding to Canada\u2019s official greenhouse gas emissions count.\n\n\u201cWe're going to have to ensure production decline as well, and that's something Dave does not believe in,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Tuesday, EDC released its new climate and sustainable finance targets, putting Collyer in an influential position with the agency as part of the ESG advisory team with a goal to transition the pollution-intensive industries it finances to a lower-carbon future. EDC plans to hit its targets by providing more loans to fossil fuel companies transitioning off oil and gas than companies increasing or maintaining production levels. EDC provides a specific breakdown of its targets in a technical summary.\n\nOther than Collyer, EDC added to its ESG advisory board chief sustainability officer of Kiwetinohk Energy Janet Annesley; Onex head of ESG Judy Cotte; OneFeather founder Lawrence Lewis; and president of Precision Biomonitoring Mario Thomas. The new members join former executive director of the World Bank Marie-Lucie Morin; director of the sustainable international development program at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Law Anita Ramasastry; and diplomat-in-residence at the University of Toronto\u2019s Massey College Rosemary McCarney."

            "article_text": "What we are looking for\n\nA Canadian small-cap name set to outperform based on a quantitative analysis model with a proven track record.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange Group\u2019s (LSEG) Starmine Relative Valuation Model is a quantitative model that measures how attractively valued a stock is using six valuation ratios: enterprise value (EV) to sales and EBITDA; price to earnings (P/E), cash flow and book value; and dividend (including share buyback) yield. For each of these ratios it considers trailing and forward 12-month periods, and for the forward (i.e. forecast) ratios it automatically puts more weight on forecasts from analysts that have historically been more accurate covering that particular stock and sector.\n\nOver the past 12 months, the model has a decile spread of 28 per cent for Canadian stocks. This means that the top 10 per cent as a group has outperformed the bottom 10 per cent by 28 per cent. However, when we look at small-cap stocks, this spread increases to 45 per cent. Put another way, if an investor simply bought the top 10 per cent and shorted the bottom 10 per cent, he or she would have earned a 45-per-cent one-year return (before transaction costs and the interest on short positions).\n\nMore about London Stock Exchange Group\n\nLSEG is one of the world\u2019s leading providers of financial markets infrastructure and delivers financial data, analytics, news and index products to more than 40,000 customers in 190 countries. Since 1698, we have been helping customers seize opportunities and create value.\n\nThe Screen\n\nWe start with a universe which is the TSX small-cap index.\n\nReplicating the top/bottom 10-per-cent strategy would involve more than 50 companies so, for simplification, we screen for only those scoring 100, i.e. the top 1 per cent.\n\nFor reference we include three of the underlying ratios used by the model: next 12-month EV/sales, P/E and dividend yield.\n\nWhat we found\n\nPromising small caps Company Ticker TRBC Industry Group EV/Sales P/E Dividend Yield Laurentian Bank of Canada LB-T Banking Services 1.07 6.79 7.4% Transcontinental Inc TCL-A-T Containers & Packaging 0.63 6.11 6.6% Alaris Equity Partners AD-UN-T Investment Banking & Investment Svcs 4.33 6.43 8.7% Neo Performance Materials NEO-T Metals & Mining 0.35 12.79 6.1% Kiwetinohk Energy Corp KEC-T Oil & Gas 1.22 2.85 0.0% InPlay Oil Corp IPO-T Oil & Gas 1.67 8.81 8.5% Canacol Energy Ltd CNE-T Oil & Gas 2.30 1.15 23.8% Gran Tierra Energy Inc GTE-T Oil & Gas 1.21 6.83 0.0% Obsidian Energy Ltd OBE-T Oil & Gas 1.03 1.97 0.0% Surge Energy Inc (Alberta) SGY-T Oil & Gas 1.24 3.10 7.1% Parex Resources Inc PXT-T Oil & Gas 2.91 4.10 7.3% Chorus Aviation Inc CHR-T Passenger Transportation Services 1.01 9.05 1.8% Cogeco Inc CGO-T Telecommunications Services 2.59 4.24 6.9% Source: LSEG\n\nMore than half of the companies scoring 100 are from the oil and gas sector. Valuation ratios are a double-edged sword, though. If a company\u2019s share price is low relative to forecast earnings, for example, that may be a sign that the stock is underappreciated by the market and should rally in the near future. However, it could also mean that the market doesn\u2019t value the longer-term prospects of the company or the industry \u2013 which may be the case for the oil and gas market in light of the energy transition. In a similar vein, it may also be that there is less demand for oil and gas stocks owing to increased focus on sustainability by big institutional investors.\n\nMining companies also traditionally aren\u2019t darlings of the ESG crowd, but Neo Performance Materials actually has a few sustainability-related tailwinds at its back. Neo is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of rare-earth magnetic powders which have numerous applications, including motors for electric vehicles and processes to remove phosphorus from waste water. The company also has geopolitical tailwinds as Western countries try to shore up supply chains of rare earths and reduce reliance on China.\n\nAnother interesting name is Alaris Equity Partners. Owning units of this company would provide exposure to one of the, if not the, hottest areas of the investment industry today \u2013 private equity \u2013 which is generally only accessible to institutional investors and ultrahigh-net-worth individuals. Headquartered in Calgary, Altaris provides financing to private companies, and its current portfolio includes companies in a diverse range of industries including health care, aerospace, retailing, steel, mining, business services and fitness. It is also sitting on more than $300-million of capital ready to be deployed in new investments \u2013 which could allow it to be opportunistic with new investments in the near future.\n\nHugh Smith, CFA, MBA, is Director, Analytics at London Stock Exchange Group."

            "article_text": "CALGARY, AB, June 14, 2022 /CNW/ - Kiwetinohk Energy Corp. (TSX: KEC) today announced record corporate upstream production rates, the acquisition of a new early stage 150 MW solar development project with a 150 MW expansion opportunity located in Central Alberta and an increase of its credit facility.\n\n\"Kiwetinohk continues to execute on its business plan, safely and reliably increasing upstream production and increasing our inventory of high-quality, no-carbon renewable power projects as we build our position as an energy transition and ESG leader,\" said CEO Pat Carlson.\n\nUpstream update\n\nMay production averaged ~16,500 boe/d, reaching ~18,500 boe/d during the first two weeks of June. Base performance from existing wells continues to exceed expectations with two new Duvernay wells brought on-stream mid-May, increasing Kiwetinohk's year-to-date new well total to six (4 Duvernay, 2 Montney).\n\nThe longest running well, a Duvernay producer at the 9-7 pad, achieved an IP90 (first 90-day production average) of ~1,500 boe/d, including ~4.0 MMcf/d of natural gas and ~800 bbl/d of condensate and is currently producing ~2,000 boe/d with ~6.0 MMcf/d of natural gas and ~1,000 bbl/d of condensate.\n\n\"Kiwetinohk is confident in our new Duvernay and Montney wells,\" said CEO Pat Carlson. \"The team continues to deliver with focus on filling our gas processing capacity and capturing market opportunities.\"\n\nDrilling at the most recent four-well pad in Simonette continues to progress efficiently with the last well expected to be drilling in the lateral within the next few days. Overall delivery of wells ahead of schedule has helped offset other industry-wide inflationary pressures. These Simonette completions are expected to commence in late June. This year's remaining development program includes spudding nine wells on three additional pads before year-end.\n\nGreen Energy update\n\nIn May, Kiwetinohk closed the acquisition of an early-stage solar development project (Solar 3 or Phoenix) in Central Alberta with a 150 MW first phase plus an optional 150 MW expansion. Green Energy 2022 capital guidance remains unchanged at $15-$20 million. The Solar 3 project is in Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) Stage 2, with environmental studies and regulatory activities underway and a targeted final investment decision in Q3 2023.\n\nSolar 3 represents a valuable addition to Kiwetinohk's diversified solar and gas-fired power portfolio, which now includes 1,950 MW of total generation capacity across six projects. Solar 3 augments the Company's existing 700 MW solar projects in southern Alberta, providing geographic diversification, expanded development alternatives, and opportunity for more construction synergies given the closely staged solar projects.\n\nKiwetinohk continues to advance development, environmental studies, regulatory activities and engineering cost estimates across its Green Energy portfolio. The Homestead Solar Project (Solar 1) recently advanced grid connection achieving AESO Stage 3 and with Alberta Utilities Commission review of the power plant and substation application underway. Capacity on the Alberta electrical grid will be confirmed and allocated to the 400 MW Homestead Solar Project at the conclusion of AESO Stage 3.\n\nKiwetinohk increased the capital cost estimate for the Homestead Solar Project to $750 million, an increase of 15% from prior estimates which reflects inflation and supply chain challenges impacting the global solar industry. Despite increased capital costs, project economics remain strong as increased industry wide capital costs are expected to result in higher structural power prices in the Alberta market going forward. Kiwetinohk's energy transition strategy and its efficient and responsive assets position the company to benefit from increased natural gas and electricity demand, a strong price environment and market volatility.\n\nEarly-stage Green Energy projects\n\n\n\nSolar 1 Firm Renewable 1 Solar 2 Solar 3 NGCC 2 NGCC 1 Capacity (nameplate) 400 MW 101 MW 300 MW 150 MW 500 MW 500 MW Capacity (net to Grid) 400 MW 97 MW 300 MW 150 MW 460 MW 460 MW Site control Options\n\nsecured Land\n\nacquisition in\n\nprogress Options\n\nsecured Options\n\nsecured Land\n\nacquisition in\n\nprogress Options\n\nsecured Public consultation Completed Completed Planning\n\nunderway Planning\n\nunderway Planning\n\nunderway Planning\n\nunderway Capacity factor 27.1% 1 50% 2 27.1% 1 27.0% 1 90 % 90 % Heat rate 8\n\n(MJ/kWh: +/-5%) - 7.6 - - 6.0 6.0 Capital cost ($ MM) $750\n\n(Class 2) $156\n\n(Class 3) 3, 5, 6 $492\n\n(Class 3) 6 $257\n\n(Class 4) 6 $875\n\n(Class 4) 3, 6 $875\n\n(Class 4) 3, 6 Regulatory/\n\nEnvironmental 4 AEP low risk\n\nrating;\n\nAUC\n\napplication\n\nsubmitted AEP and AUC\n\napplications\n\nsubmitted AEP low risk\n\nrating Work\n\nunderway Work\n\nunderway Work\n\nunderway AESO stage 7 3 2 1 2 2 2 Targeted FID Q3 2022 Q4 2022 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q3 2024 Targeted COD Q4 2024 Q4 2024 Q2 2025 Q1 2025 Q4 2026 Q3 2027\n\n\n\n1 Capacity factor over 25\u2013year project life based on DC/AC ratio of 1.35, and bifacial, single axis tracking design. 2 Designed for intermittent operation.

Other lenders in the facility include Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia and Business Development Bank of Canada.\n\nThe increased borrowing limit provides:\n\nAmple liquidity for current operations, including letters of credit for ongoing marketing activities. Updated liquidity metrics will be provided as part of the Company's second quarter news release, expected in mid-August\n\nAdditional funding flexibility, further bolstering the Company's strong operational cash flows, for the 2022 planned capital program\n\nFunding support for potential acquisition / growth opportunities\n\nKiwetinohk's next semi-annual credit facility borrowing base review is expected in November, 2022.\n\nAbout Kiwetinohk\n\nWe, at Kiwetinohk, are passionate about climate change and the future of energy.

A boe conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas per barrel of oil (6 mcf:1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and do not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from an energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion ratio of 6:1 may be misleading as an indication of value.\n\nForward looking information\n\nCertain information set forth in this news release contains forward-looking information and statements including, without limitation, management's business strategy, management's assessment of future plans and operations.
