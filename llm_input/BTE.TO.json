            "article_text": "Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Baytex Energy Corp. ( ) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Baytex Energy's shares before the 13th of December in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of January.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is CA$0.0225 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of CA$0.09 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Baytex Energy has a trailing yield of 2.5% on the current stock price of CA$3.66. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Baytex Energy's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Baytex Energy's dividend is not well covered by earnings, as the company lost money last year. This is not a sustainable state of affairs, so it would be worth investigating if earnings are expected to recover. Given that the company reported a loss last year, we now need to see if it generated enough free cash flow to fund the dividend. If Baytex Energy didn't generate enough cash to pay the dividend, then it must have either paid from cash in the bank or by borrowing money, neither of which is sustainable in the long term. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 13% of its cash flow last year.\n\nClick\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Baytex Energy was unprofitable last year, but at least the general trend suggests its earnings have been improving over the past five years. Even so, an unprofitable company whose business does not quickly recover is usually not a good candidate for dividend investors.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Baytex Energy has seen its dividend decline 29% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see.\n\nWe update our analysis on Baytex Energy every 24 hours, so you can always\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nShould investors buy Baytex Energy for the upcoming dividend? It's hard to get used to Baytex Energy paying a dividend despite reporting a loss over the past year. At least the dividend was covered by free cash flow, however. To summarise, Baytex Energy looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity.\n\nIn light of that, while Baytex Energy has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. In terms of investment risks, and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

            "article_text": "Simply sign up to the Hedge funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHedge funds have been quietly scooping up the shares of unloved oil and gas companies discarded by environmentally minded institutional investors, and are now reaping big gains as energy prices surge.\n\nHedge fund managers in the US and UK have been betting that the eagerness of many big institutions to be seen to embrace environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards means they are selling wholesale out of fossil fuel stocks, even though demand for some of these products remains high.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a great and easy idea,\u201d Crispin Odey, founder of London-based Odey Asset Management, told the Financial Times.\n\n\u201cThey [big institutional investors] are all so keen to get rid of oil assets, they\u2019re leaving fantastic returns on the table,\u201d added Odey, whose European fund is up more than 100 per cent so far this year.\n\nThe company has been building its position in oil and gas stocks this year and has sizeable stakes in groups including Norwegian oil company Aker BP, whose shares are up about 43 per cent, and Asia-Pacific-focused producer Jadestone Energy, up 44 per cent.\n\nOdey said he had also been providing financing for unlisted vehicles that are being set up by commodities companies specifically to buy up unwanted assets being sold off by the oil majors.\n\nThe move away from fossil fuels by big institutions has often left hedge funds, which face fewer pressures to conform to ESG norms than mainstream fund companies, among the only buyers. This can present attractive opportunities, although it can leave them exposed to falls in energy prices or further selling by big investors.\n\nHedge fund managers argue that investment in oil and gas production is still badly needed \u00a9 Orlin Wagner/AP\n\nAlongside Odey\u2019s fund, Goldman Sachs\u2019s prime brokerage division, which provides a range of services such as stock lending and execution, recently told clients that energy stocks had had their biggest net buying by hedge funds since late February, according to a note seen by the FT.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how much money you can make in things that people hate,\u201d said Bison Interests\u2019 managing partner and co-founder Josh Young, who says his fund avoids the \u201cdirtiest companies\u201d.\n\nBison Interests has profited from positions in companies including Canadian oil and gas group Baytex Energy Corp and US-based SandRidge Energy and is up 377 per cent this year before fees, according to a person familiar with the matter, ranking it as one of the world\u2019s top-performing funds.\n\n\u201cMany of these companies are trading at very low cash flow multiples and at very big discounts to the replacement value of their assets,\u201d said Young. \u201cMore people are driving gas-powered cars and scooters than ever.\u201d\n\nThe pressure on institutional investors from climate lobby groups to stop funding fossil fuel companies has intensified markedly in recent years.\n\nPension funds, charities, churches and other faith groups and universities, which may own some stocks either directly or through funds they hold, are among those that have committed to selling out of such companies as a way of combating climate change and shifting investment towards more renewable forms of energy.\n\nClimate activism group DivestInvest, which pushes investors to make no new investments in the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies and to sell any such positions within three to five years, says it has received pledges from more than 1,300 organisations managing $14.5tn in assets.\n\nHedge fund managers buying up these stocks argue that investment in areas such as oil and gas production is still badly needed, as highlighted by recent moves in the energy market. Oil prices hit their highest level in at least three years this week, while UK gas prices have more than quadrupled.\n\nCompanies often use their revenues from oil and gas to fund a transition to cleaner energy, say hedge fund managers, and halting investment into these stocks hurts this process.\n\n\u201cThe ESG guys are causing terrible problems,\u201d said Odey. \u201cThey\u2019re ensuring price rises are not met by supply.\u201d\n\nAnother European-based manager said moves by big investors to stop backing fossil fuel companies may be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d, adding that the sector offers a \u201chuge investment opportunity\u201d for their fund.\n\nRenaud Saleur, a former trader at Soros Fund Management and Jabre Capital, who now heads Anaconda Invest, said the effect was particularly striking in Europe, where investors had embraced ESG concerns to a greater extent than in the US.\n\n\u201cIn Europe, people have been more keen to blackwash the oil and gas industry. It\u2019s mere stupidity, this [sector] produces money to fund the energy transition,\u201d he said, adding that these investors were also pushing stocks in sectors such as electric vehicles and hydrogen to \u201cunsustainable levels\u201d. He has backed companies including ShaMaran Petroleum and Australian energy group Santos.\n\nTwice weekly newsletter Energy is the world\u2019s indispensable business and Energy Source is its newsletter. Every Tuesday and Thursday, direct to your inbox, Energy Source brings you essential news, forward-thinking analysis and insider intelligence. Sign up here.\n\nAs hedge funds search for targets, Jadestone has attracted a number of other investors in addition to Odey including Tyrus Capital, which owns about 25 per cent, and Polar Capital.\n\nAnd hedge funds including Taconic and Kite Lake have this year gained control of Norwegian Energy Company (Noreco), a North Sea oil and gas producer whose shares collapsed by more than 99 per cent from their pre-financial crisis high, taking board seats.\n\nNoreco has benefited from buying Danish upstream assets from Shell, with the help of financing from hedge funds. Shares in Noreco, which also counts hedge fund Astaris Capital among its investors, have risen about 10 per cent this year.\n\nSmaller energy stocks, which hedge funds often favour, have benefited from buying cheap oil and gas assets from the oil majors, which face investor pressure to divest from fossil fuels. But there are signs that oil majors may be growing wary of such sales.\n\nEarlier this year Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, chief executive of Total, told the FT that selling assets to other producers that may be less mindful of ESG concerns was not a solution. \u201cEven if BP, Total and Shell divest from oil and gas it does not change anything,\u201d he said."

            "article_text": "Factors spurring sector momentum\n\nAfter years of headwinds, Canadian energy sector participants are cautiously optimistic that a longer-term recovery is underway. Anticipated demand growth coupled with supply restraint has spurred a rally in oil and gas prices that looks to have legs heading into 2022. OPEC+ has recommitted to its plan to gradually increase production, providing further support for a positive price outlook. Meanwhile, the start-up of Enbridge\u2019s Line 3 pipeline could improve the price differential between WCS and WTI, and the expected completion of the TMX pipeline and the LNG Canada projects over the next few years will help to alleviate takeaway capacity issues for Western Canadian producers.\n\nSustained commodity prices and a more positive outlook have supported M&A and capital raising activity in the sector, while companies have been able to generate significant amounts of free cashflow. The last few months have also seen the announcement of a number of significant carbon offset projects, with a particular emphasis on carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS). These themes are discussed in more detail below.\n\nM&A activity\n\nAfter a busy first half of 2021, M&A activity in the Canadian energy sector remains robust across the upstream, midstream and downstream subsectors. Dealmaking continues to be driven primarily by consolidation, non-core asset sales and asset portfolio rebalancing, as companies seek value through scale and lowering the carbon intensity of their assets. Certain high-profile examples include Brookfield Infrastructure\u2019s $15.3 billion acquisition of Inter Pipeline and Seven Generations\u2019 $4.8 billion combination with ARC Resources.\n\nEquity participation in projects by Indigenous groups has provided a further driver for deal activity. For example, Suncor recently partnered with eight Indigenous communities to acquire TC Energy\u2019s 15% stake in the Northern Courier Pipeline with a value of approximately $1.3 billion. The remaining 85% interest in the pipeline is held by AIMCo. Earlier this year, Haisla Nation partnered with Pembina Pipeline in the development of the proposed $3 billion Cedar LNG project in Kitimat, British Columbia.\n\nWe expect that these same underlying factors, and increased participation by Indigenous groups, will continue to drive strong M&A activity into 2022.\n\nCapital markets"

This vision will be underpinned by the New Management Team\u2019s strong technical and commercial capabilities in executing international M&A, and by an acquisition pipeline that is expected to result in operating economies of scale and a meaningful capital markets presence within five years.\n\nUpon completion of the Transaction, the Company intends to target conventional and semi-conventional assets in overseas markets that can support a free cash flow operating model. These international assets, as compared to North American assets, have exposure to premium-priced commodity markets, offer lower acquisition multiples, and typically contain greater opportunities for operational improvements after acquisition. A \u201cwide funnel\u201d approach to asset screening will initially be employed to facilitate exposure to a wide range of potentially high return opportunities in three target regions of Europe, Middle East & North Africa (MENA) and South America. Following an initial cornerstone acquisition(s), the New Management Team expects to focus on consolidation and building economies of scale in the one or two operating regions containing the cornerstone acquisition(s). The portfolio of assets developed over time is expected to fund a growth-and-income capital markets model, ultimately providing cash returns to shareholders through dividends.\n\n\u201cWe see great opportunity in international markets to capture quality M&A opportunities at this time. We believe the sector is underinvested, with a significant number of quality oil and gas assets on the market, and only a limited set of qualified buyers to invest in them. Altura provides a free cash flow generating asset and a desirable entity to recapitalize in pursuit of our acquisition strategy. Following the Transaction, the Company will be positioned with both operating and financial capability to take advantage of this international M&A market\u201d said Anthony Marino, on behalf of the Initial Investors.\n\nMarty Proctor, Chair of the New Board, said \u201cWe believe that responsible oil and gas production is a critical element of the energy transition, and we will emphasize sustainability with ESG performance at the foundation of our strategy.\u201d\n\nAltura Asset Base\n\nAltura currently has approximately 1,100 boe/d of oil-weighted production in a semi-conventional development project in Central Alberta. At December 31, 2020, there were 47 gross booked proved plus probable locations with over 100 gross additional, potential drilling opportunities identified. Altura\u2019s asset base is compact and largely contiguous with ample processing capacity, product egress and low asset retirement obligations. At current strip pricing, Altura\u2019s assets support moderate production growth while generating free cash flow. Upon completion of the Transaction, the free cash flow generated by the base asset will be deployed to support the new corporate strategy and will augment the capital raised via the Private Placement.\n\nPrivate Placement\n\nThe Initial Investors, together with additional subscribers identified by them, will subscribe for a minimum of 22,222,222 units of the Company (\u201cUnits\u201d) at a price of $0.18 per Unit for minimum gross proceeds of $4 million (the \u201cNon-Brokered Private Placement\u201d). Each Unit will be comprised of one common share of the Company (a \u201cCommon Share\u201d) and one warrant of the Company (a \u201cWarrant\u201c). Each Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one Common Share at a price of $0.18 per Common Share for a period of 5 years from the issuance date. One-third of the Warrants will vest and become exercisable upon the 20-day VWAP of the Common Shares (the \u201cMarket Price\u201c) equaling or exceeding $0.25 per Common Share, an additional one-third upon the Market Price equaling or exceeding $0.315 per Common Share and a final one-third upon the Market Price equaling or exceeding $0.36 per Common Share. Closing of the Non-Brokered Private Placement will occur contemporaneously with the appointment of the New Management Team and New Board (collectively, the \u201cChange of Management\u201d).\n\nConcurrently, a brokered private placement will be completed by a syndicate of dealers led by National Bank Financial Inc. and including Royal Bank of Canada, Stifel FirstEnergy and ATB Financial for a minimum of 116,666,667 subscription receipts of the Company (\u201cSubscription Receipts\u201d) at a price of $0.18 per Subscription Receipt for minimum gross proceeds of $21 million (the \u201cBrokered Private Placement\u201d). Each Subscription Receipt will entitle the holder thereof to receive one Common Share for no additional consideration and without any further action, upon: (i) completion of the Change of Management and the Non-Brokered Private Placement in accordance with the Investment Agreement and without material waiver thereof unless the consent of National Bank Financial Inc. is given to such waiver, acting reasonably, and (ii) provided that there has been no material amendments to the Investment Agreement which have not been approved by National Bank Financial Inc., acting reasonably, in each case, prior to October 29, 2021. Closing of the Brokered Private Placement is expected to occur on or about September 22, 2021.\n\nAll securities issued in connection with the Private Placement will be subject to a Canadian statutory hold period of four months plus one day from the respective date of closing.\n\nProceeds from the Private Placement will be used for general corporate purposes and to partially fund the acquisition of global oil and gas assets, supporting the New Management Team\u2019s strategy of building a portfolio of free cash flow assets that can provide returns to shareholders via a growth-and-income model. The Transaction is subject to the Private Placement raising gross proceeds.\n\nRights Offering\n\nUpon completion of the Transaction, Altura shareholders will be entitled to participate in a rights offering, by way of a rights offering circular (the \u201cRights Offering\u201d). Pursuant to the Rights Offering, each Altura shareholder as of the record date for such offering (the \u201cRecord Date\u201c) will be issued one right (\u201cRight\u201c) for each Common Share held on the Record Date, entitling that holder to purchase one Common Share for each eight Rights held at a price of $0.18 per Common Share at or before the expiry time of the Rights Offering, following which all outstanding Rights shall terminate and expire. Subscribers under the Private Placement will not be entitled to participate in the Rights Offering with respect to any securities acquired pursuant to the Private Placement. The Rights Offering is subject to applicable regulatory approval, including by the TSXV.\n\nOptions\n\nCertain holders of options of Altura (\u201cOptions\u201d) have agreed with the Initial Investors that all Options held by them, except for 4.8 million options having an exercise price of $0.21 per Common Share, will terminate upon closing of the Transaction.

            "article_text": "The Suncor tar sands processing plant near the Athabasca River at their mining operations near Fort McMurray, Alberta, in this file photo taken September 17, 2014.TODD KOROL/Reuters Share\n\nSuncor Energy Inc. is shedding more staff to prepare for lean times in the oil industry to last longer, even as crude prices climb above $40 (U.S.) a barrel for the first time in 3 1/2 months.\n\nSuncor, Canada's largest oil company, is reducing its work force by an unspecified number, partly in response to deferrals of big-ticket expansion projects in the oil sands and at a Quebec refinery.\n\nSpokeswoman Sneh Seetal said she could not provide a precise tally, but that the reductions will not climb into the thousands. The cuts follow a reduction of more than 1,700 workers last year, representing about 12 per cent of total staff.\n\nThe company's previous layoffs contributed to more than 41,000 direct job losses in the oil industry as crude prices sank from more than $100 a barrel in mid-2014 to just above $26 last month. On Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude settled up $1.74 at $40.20 a barrel, its highest since Dec. 3.\n\nSuncor chief executive officer Steve Williams informed employees of the new round of cuts this week.\n\nHe is looking to run lean as commodity prices still look uncertain, despite the recent oil-price runup. When it announced its loss-making fourth-quarter results last month, Suncor said it was shelving a heavy oil processing unit at its Montreal refinery and future expansions of its steam-assisted oil sands projects.\n\n\"As those business decisions are made, our work-force requirements will change and unfortunately this means some people will leave the organization,\" Ms. Seetal said.\n\n\"We know this is a stressful time for people. That's why we're committed to being as open and transparent with our employees as we can and in fact Steve addressed this topic in his regular quarterly webcast he had with employees on Tuesday.\"\n\nThe move reflects nagging doubts in the industry that the sharp rally in crude markets will evolve into a meaningful recovery. A weakening U.S. dollar and renewed optimism over a possible deal by some of the world's top exporters to freeze output at January highs are seen as top reasons for the latest surge.\n\nBut an output pact is viewed largely as symbolic and unlikely to restore prices to pre-crash levels, said Judith Dwarkin, an analyst at RS Energy Group in Calgary.\n\nMany members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are already pumping at capacity, while global inventories are likely to remain bloated until next year, despite strengthening demand and signs of faltering output from U.S. shale producers, she said.\n\n\"I think the fundamentals are such that we're going to continue to see a pretty large supply overhang even with the freeze,\" she said in an interview.\n\nFor Suncor, that necessitates tapping the brakes on continuous expansion of oil sands projects, while at the same time completing its $4.2-billion (Canadian) takeover of rival Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. COS shareholders are slated to vote on the deal on Monday.\n\nSuncor's so-called \"replication\" strategy was touted by executives as a cheaper method of lifting crude from underneath northern Alberta's forests. It involves designing cookie-cutter plants to tap pockets of bitumen, rather than a central processing plant to harvest a larger region.\n\nOther cost-cutting moves include deferring large information-technology projects and looking for ways to consolidate work across various departments, Ms. Seetal said.\n\nAnalysts have estimated the company's funding gap this year at $4-billion as spending ramps up on major projects, including its $15-billion Fort Hills bitumen mine and its Hebron joint venture offshore Newfoundland and Labrador. Last month, the company chopped its 2016 budget by 10 per cent to a range of $6-billion to $6.5-billion.\n\nIt is far from alone with capital spending cuts. Last week, Crescent Point Energy Corp. slashed its dividend by 70 per cent and deferred $100-million in planned spending until later this year. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and Baytex Energy Corp. have also dialled back expenditures this year.\n\nIn February, Husky Energy Inc. also announced deeper job cuts, although it did not specify a number."

            "article_text": "San Francisco City & County Employees\u2019 Retirement System approved changes to its environmental, social and governance policies, including the addition of oil and gas and thermal coal companies to its restricted investments list.\n\nThe $36.6 billion pension fund\u2019s board approved the recommendations by Andrew Collins, director of ESG investing, and Blake Broadnax, investment officer, ESG investing, at its Dec. 11 meeting as a result of their annual ESG review, a spokesperson said.\n\nAmong oil and gas companies, the staff, utilizing MSCI ESG Research data, recommended adding Civitas Resources Inc. to its restricted list. As of June 30, SFERS had about $754,932 invested with the company that is subject to divest.\n\nAs of that same date, overall publicly traded oil and gas companies accounted for about $227 million of the pension fund\u2019s assets, or about 0.6% of SFERS\u2019 total portfolio. Overall, pension fund staff has identified 38 companies that are identified as high risk and are on the pension fund\u2019s watchlist. Among that list are six firms identified for priority engagement based on SFERS\u2019 net exposure to the companies, previous engagement efforts and their presence on the pension fund\u2019s 2023 watchlist and priority engagement lists: Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Petrobras and Suncor Energy.\n\nCivitas Resources joins Baytex Energy Corp., Expand Energy Corp. and Verne Inc. on the pension fund\u2019s list of restricted oil and gas companies.\n\nAmong thermal coal companies, staff recommended adding Kinetic Development Group Ltd. to its restricted list because the company derives more than 50% of its revenues from thermal coal mining, as well as African Rainbow Minerals Ltd., Siam City Cement Public Co. Ltd., and Sumiseki Holdings Inc. because the companies derive between 10% and 50% of their revenues from thermal coal mining and have no plans to exit the business. SFERS is not directly invested in any of the companies.\n\nStaff also recommended removing Allete Inc. and Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA from the restricted list because the two companies now derive less than 10% of their revenues from thermal coal mining.\n\nSFERS has a list of 56 companies restricted because of their thermal coal involvement.\n\nAmong U.S. tobacco companies, staff recommended removing Mativ Holdings Inc. from the restricted list because the company is no longer involved with tobacco production or distribution. The removal brings the restricted list down to 18 companies involved in tobacco production or distribution.\n\nCollins and Broadnax had no recommended additions or removals to restricted lists for firearm companies or Sudan-related companies."
