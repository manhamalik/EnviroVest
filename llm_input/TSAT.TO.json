            "article_text": "Global investment leader selects AWS as a preferred cloud provider to gain business insights, improve workplace safety, and automate hydroelectric, wind, and solar operations\n\nBrookfield Renewable agrees to provide clean energy capacity to power Amazon\u2019s operations on three continents\n\nAt AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc., an Amazon.com, Inc. company, announced that Brookfield Asset Management, one of the world\u2019s leading investors in renewable power, has selected AWS as a preferred cloud provider to accelerate its digital transformation and become a more data-driven company in the cloud. Brookfield migrated its legacy systems to AWS and is using AWS\u2019s analytics, containers, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and storage capabilities, as well as AWS\u2019s extensive partner network, to modernize its technology infrastructure, optimize operations, and boost innovation.\n\nIn addition to its agreement with AWS, Brookfield Renewable, a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management and one of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded renewable power platforms, will provide 601.6 megawatts (MW) of clean wind and solar energy capacity to power Amazon\u2019s operations in Europe, North America, and India. In total, these projects are expected to generate 1,370 gigawatt-hours (GWh), which is enough to power more than 120,000 U.S. homes per year.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with Amazon is a tremendously exciting example of companies working together to reach net zero,\u201d said Ruth Kent, chief operating officer at Brookfield Renewable. \u201cAWS is helping us modernize our operational systems, giving us the scalability, reliability, and innovation we need to deliver clean energy around the world. In return, Brookfield Renewable will provide renewable power to Amazon on three continents, which will help Amazon stay on path to power its operations with 100% renewable energy. We look forward to seeing what more this partnership can bring in the future.\u201d\n\nWorking with AWS Professional Services, AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) BDO Lixar, and AWS Partner Databricks, Brookfield Asset Management consolidated 40 petabytes of data in a data lake on AWS to optimize facility operations, increase production output, and improve equipment performance. Applying AWS machine learning and analytics capabilities to this data helps the company automate key aspects of its operations. These capabilities enable Brookfield to proactively manage complex commercial transactions, improve returns on assets, and reduce operating costs. Brookfield Asset Management also uses Databricks\u2019 Lakehouse Platform on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to provide a central data analytics platform that is increasing operational efficiency and reducing costs across more than 10 internal business organizations (including Trading, Risk, Origination, and Operations).\n\nSee related article: Descartes Labs and AWS to Help Organizations Address Sustainability, Food Security, and Climate Change\n\nIn addition, Brookfield Asset Management is implementing improved workplace safety technology, collaborating with AWS and AWS Partner Blackline Safety to provide real-time employee safety monitoring at three hydroelectric dam sites in the U.S. Employees wear Blackline\u2019s G7 wearable safety devices, which rely on Amazon Kinesis (AWS\u2019s service for easily collecting, processing, and analyzing video and data streams in real time) for high-speed streaming data ingestion of location and safety data into the cloud, and Amazon Redshift (AWS\u2019s cloud data warehouse) to detect if an employee is in danger or needs assistance, thereby triggering an alert for supervisors to send help.\n\n\u201cTogether with Brookfield Asset Management, we are advancing the use of renewable energy around the globe,\u201d said Howard Gefen, general manager of Energy & Utilities at AWS. \u201cBrookfield is tapping into the breadth and depth of AWS\u2019s proven global infrastructure, services, and partner community to better harness its data, become more flexible and scalable, and gain better insights into its businesses. In addition, working with Brookfield Renewable will keep Amazon on the path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy while adding more clean energy to grids around the world.\u201d\n\nThe collaboration announced today keeps Amazon on track to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of its original 2030 commitment, and to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. The committed 601.6 MW of power purchase agreements (PPAs) will provide electricity to seven Amazon projects\u2014three in the United States (in Arkansas, Illinois, and Mississippi), three in Europe (in Spain, Northern Ireland, and Italy), and one of Amazon\u2019s first projects in India."

            "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: Cody Slater CEO and Chairman of Calgary based Blackline Safety, which designs and manufactures a line of devices programmed to detect a number of potentially harmful gasses.Glenn Lowson/The Globe and Mail\n\nESG has been part and parcel of Cody Slater\u2019s business from the start. Now, though, with the stock market cratering, ESG \u2013 environmental, social and governance \u2013 has dropped a few notches on the priority list for investors in his company, Blackline Safety Corp., he says.\n\nBlackline manufactures and sells wearable software-enabled sensors used to detect noxious gases that could kill workers. As a safety item, Blackline\u2019s products help a global roster of customers such as Shell PLC and Tyson Foods Inc. bolster their records in the S category \u2013 social. Meanwhile, Calgary-based Blackline has joined countless other companies in putting its own ESG programs into force, including issuing a yearly report on its progress.\n\nThis all remains important, says Mr. Slater, Blackline\u2019s chief executive officer. But the clamour from investors demanding more stringent sustainability programs is being drowned out by a string of global crises, and worries about weakness in financial markets.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a portion of the ESG world that\u2019s always been a bit of a bandwagon I think, and when times are good and everything\u2019s great, it\u2019s easy to talk about and easy to have more focus on,\u201d Mr. Slater says.\n\nNow, it\u2019s not so easy. Amid a tech industry meltdown, Blackline\u2019s share price is down by more than half since the start of the year, even as it was named to the Financial Times list of the 500 fastest growing companies in the Americas.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it changes the fundamental desire from an investor standpoint, but it definitely changes the focus point \u2013 focus is off ESG,\u201d Mr. Slater says.\n\nThe push for sustainability was a massive force in business in the first part of the COVID-19 pandemic, but in 2022, it has come under fire. As Mr. Slater says, market and social turmoil have shifted investor priorities. But ESG has become a battleground with many fronts.\n\nSome politicians and business leaders blame the rush to carbon-free energy as a contributor to surging oil and gas prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine worsened an already-tight global supply situation. In addition, critics say investors in some ESG funds are being misled into believing their money is used to fight climate change and racial inequality when that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nMeanwhile, regulators in Canada and around the world are demanding more stringent disclosure of ESG performance, leading to higher compliance costs for companies. And some of the world\u2019s major banks are under investigation for greenwashing.\n\nAmid this upheaval, CEOs must keep navigating the ESG world alongside all their other responsibilities. Canadian corporations, especially large ones, have implemented extensive sustainability programs, and their boards are responsible for overseeing them. Major institutional shareholders, from pension funds to asset managers such as BlackRock Inc., still want increasing volumes of data on everything from greenhouse gases to gender diversity among directors. For some corporate bosses, a portion of their compensation is even tied to meeting ESG-related goals.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Don Lindsay, CEO of Vancouver-based Teck Resources Ltd.JENNIFER GAUTHIER/https://secure.tgam.arcpublishing.com/composer/edit/CFXXI5KBPNDCLG4SIEYJ6RF2GE/\n\nWith all of this swirling, The Globe and Mail asked CEOs: Can the push to turn businesses into forces for social and environmental good survive in a world of crisis and political polarization? If so, are we headed for a new generation of ESG?\n\nFor Don Lindsay, CEO of Vancouver-based Teck Resources Ltd., his company\u2019s prospects still depend on improving its environmental record. As a copper and zinc miner, its output is prized in renewable energy technology. But Teck also produces steelmaking coal and crude in the oil sands, and both are scrutinized for high carbon emissions.\n\nEven so, Mr. Lindsay sees no turning back from Teck\u2019s sustainability push, which features a recently toughened company target to get to net-zero emissions, and donations of thousands of hectares of land for ecosystem preservation.\n\nIn the weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, some of the company\u2019s investors predicted the end of the push to a transition to a low-carbon global economy. \u201cIt\u2019s on the back burner. It\u2019s all about energy security now,\u201d he says, summing up that attitude.\n\n\u201cBut that changed back pretty quickly when people determined that the way to get energy security is through energy transition,\u201d Mr. Lindsay says. \u201cAnd so I think some of these global events, sad as they are, have actually strengthened the resolve of the world and accelerated the investment in energy transition.\u201d\n\nHe says some of the skepticism that has overshadowed ESG is a reaction to the inexact science of scores that third-party ratings agencies provide for companies \u2013 and which form the basis of some exchange-traded funds. The agencies measure CO2 emissions, climate-related targets, work force diversity and a wide range of other metrics deemed to be material to a business\u2019s risk profile. In many cases, the scores estimate how companies are protected against ESG-related risks more than they show a company\u2019s full impact in the three areas.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Tesla Inc. \u2013 the company credited with turning electric cars into green status symbols \u2013 was dropped from the S&P 500 ESG index in May, much to founder and CEO Elon Musk's displeasure.POOL/Reuters\n\nThe debate burst into the public realm in May, when Tesla Inc. \u2013 the company credited with turning electric cars into green status symbols \u2013 was dropped from the S&P 500 ESG index. Tesla founder Elon Musk tweeted his displeasure with the move: ESG and ratings that measure performance are a \u201cscam\u201d that has been \u201cweaponized by phony social justice warriors,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe company failed to make the cut after its ESG ratings fell because of a number of factors, including its lack of a low-carbon strategy and codes of business conduct, S&P explained.\n\nParticularly galling for Mr. Musk, oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. was added to the index, despite its carbon emissions and years of lobbying against tougher action on climate change. S&P rated Exxon Mobil\u2019s ESG programs as acceptable for its industry.\n\n\u201cIt is complex. There are a great many agencies who are generally self-anointed, who come up with their own formulas for measuring how you\u2019re doing on ESG,\u201d Mr. Lindsay says. \u201cWe do quite well. We\u2019re number one in some indices, number two in the others that are generally highly regarded. But the complexity of all those indices, and everyone having their own priorities, could make you a bit cynical about whether the measurement is valid.\u201d\n\nESG has been a factor in global markets for decades, albeit with different names, including ethical investing, responsible investing and sustainable investing. Companies have become accustomed to issuing annual corporate social responsibility reports to let investors and other stakeholders know about their non-financial priorities.\n\nOver the past decade, the field morphed into an overlay to other corporate performance measures, to be sliced and diced into data highlighting risks and opportunities for companies and their investors. But ESG investing still occupied a niche in finance.\n\nFor the first time in years, more cash was drained from ESG-themed exchange-traded funds than invested U.S.-listed ESG ETF monthly funds flow (US$ millions) $8,000 Broad ESG equity 7,000 Environment and clean energy equity 6,000 Fixed income Other 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 -1,000 May Jan. 2021 May Sept.

With economies forced into lockdown, society in general \u2013 and financial markets in particular \u2013 saw how vulnerable the world is to shocks. Executives and investors took note of how other systemic problems, such as climate change and racial inequality, present major risks that have to be dealt with.\n\nAs the climate crisis has become more acute, the transition to a low-carbon economy emerged as the top focus, forcing energy, transport and mining companies to devise goals to cut carbon emissions. That shift also helped renewable energy and other cleantech startups flourish. For investors, ESG became an asset class unto itself, with money in mutual and other investment funds topping US$2.7-trillion worldwide.\n\nBut this year, a lot of those investments have cratered as jittery markets abandoned long-term growth ambitions and turned attention to the need for investments offering immediate cash flow. In May, U.S. ESG funds suffered their first outflow of money since 2019, says Baltej Sidhu, ESG analyst at National Bank of Canada.\n\nYet the pullback will not change the long-term ESG focus for Manulife Financial Corp.\u2019s asset management arm, Manulife Investment Management, says Paul Lorentz, the unit\u2019s CEO. In fact, nearly all the investment mandates the firm bids on now demand proof of its ESG expertise and performance, Mr. Lorentz says. \u201cIt may vary a little bit by geography, but it\u2019s becoming table stakes now in terms of what investors are expecting or what asset owners are expecting.\u201d\n\nDespite the market turmoil, the insurer\u2019s investment division, which has $860-billion under management, still sees steady demand for investments that reflect more than just profit, he says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much noise out there, but I think what matters is, are they comfortable with the companies that they\u2019re dealing with? Are they really proud of what those organizations are trying to do to their business, to further the agenda?\u201d\n\nSome of that noise has come from politicians and business leaders, especially in the United States. They chafe with the machinations of ESG and its increasingly detailed disclosure and target-setting requirements. Regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Canadian Securities Administrators, are among authorities demanding more reporting on ESG measures while they also vet corporate environmental claims to combat greenwashing. They are facing pushback from many companies and their industry associations.\n\nMajor financial institutions, such as Deutsche Bank\u2019s DWS unit and Goldman Sachs, are under investigation for the veracity of ESG promises in investment funds. In March, the SEC hit BNY Mellon with a US$1.5-million fine for misstatements and omissions.\n\nOn the other hand, inflation and fuel shortages, partly due to international sanctions in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, have pinched consumers and helped fuel skepticism about a shift to green energy.\n\nDarren Gee, CEO of Peyto Exploration & Development Corp., a Calgary-based natural gas producer, said some factions of society fell victim to the belief that the transition to low-carbon energy could be done quickly without having to worry about reliability and affordability. He laments how natural gas is often lumped in with dirtier forms of energy. He says it should be shipped globally to displace coal, as demand for fossil fuels remains.\n\n\u201cI think we were rushing into something without really thinking deeply about it,\u201d Mr. Gee says. \u201cIt\u2019s a rush to try and create a system of governance on the supply. This has no impact on demand. And yet it\u2019s demand that we want to affect. Governments around the world, free societies like North America, where we have institutions that are trying to do what they can are all focused on supplies. None of them are focused on demand.\u201d\n\nThe energy industry has been at the centre of debates over environmental impact for decades. As recently as a year ago, some institutional investors warned Canadian oil and gas producers their access to capital would be cut off unless those companies upped their games on ESG \u2013 specifically carbon emissions. A few pension and university endowment funds, such as the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec and Harvard Management Co., publicized their decisions to divest from the sector.\n\nNow, with the prices of energy commodities at multiyear highs, access to capital is of little concern \u2013 much of the industry has more money than it can spend profitably by increasing production. Instead, companies have paid down debt, raised dividends and bought back shares.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Calgary-based Blackline Safety, which engineers and manufactures safety devices, has joined countless other companies in putting its own ESG programs into force, including issuing a yearly report on its progress.Glenn Lowson/The globe and mail\n\nMr. Gee says ESG has not moved on Peyto\u2019s priority list, even as energy security and prices have blasted to the fore.\n\n\u201cWe as a company have always been extremely focused on efficiency and as a result of being as efficient as we can be, we have traditionally led the industry in our cost structure. We\u2019re the lowest-cost producer,\u201d he says. \u201cThat low cost and that efficiency also flows through to environmental performance. We\u2019re not wasteful and generally the environmental impact is worse when you\u2019re wasteful.\u201d\n\nAs a business concept, ESG has attracted some big-name enemies. Texas legislators passed a law last year that penalizes firms for excluding oil and gas holdings by preventing those firms from doing business with the state\u2019s pension and investment funds. Other states, including West Virginia, are following suit. Former U.S. vice-president Mike Pence has decried ESG regulations that he said \u201callow left-wing radicals to destroy American energy producers from within.\u201d\n\nOne leading light of the \u201cstakeholder capitalism\u201d movement has taken pains to explain he is not some kind of left-wing activist. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc., the world\u2019s largest asset manager, and the man credited with bringing ESG investing into the mainstream, used his annual letter to business leaders in January to send the message that he does not have a \u201cwoke\u201d ideological agenda.\n\n\u201cIt is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper. This is the power of capitalism,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote.\n\nSo far, the U.S. has proved to be more politically polarized on sustainability issues than Canada, Mr. Sidhu says. \u201cMost people in Canada know that our resources are more on the carbon-intensive side, and there is a need for us to at least get it down to a median on the global scale. I think [the backlash] is not going to be as pronounced as we\u2019ve seen it in the States.\u201d\n\nStill, ESG is proving contentious globally as well. In May, Stuart Kirk, who was global head of responsible investment at HSBC Investment Management, made waves when he gave a speech criticizing those who make doomsday predictions about global warming and play up the finance industry\u2019s responsibilities for combatting it.\n\nHis remarks, at the Financial Times\u2019 Moral Money Summit, went viral and prompted the HSBC\u2019s CEO to issue a statement saying they did not represent the views of the British financial giant, which remains focused on net-zero goals. HSBC suspended the 27-year veteran, fuelling a debate over accusations of corporate cancel culture.\n\nMr. Kirk resigned this past week, promising to \u201ccontinue to prod with a sharp stick the nonsense, hypocrisy, sloppy logic and group-think inside the mainstream bubble of sustainable finance.\u201d\n\nAmid the turmoil, the onus remains on companies across industries to live up to their claims and be transparent with their reporting so investors are confident they are putting put their money where it has positive impact, and aligns with global environmental and social goals, Mr. Lorentz says. \u201cUnfortunately there are examples out there where this hasn\u2019t always been the case.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the problems ESG is supposed to address, notably climate change, still exist, and are getting tougher to counteract as the energy crisis persists. This year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said solutions for reducing greenhouse gases are available, but it is an open question whether they can be scaled up quickly enough to meet international commitments and head off the worst impacts of global warming.\n\nMr. Lindsay says there is more than enough evidence. He points to the environmental devastation in Teck\u2019s home province of British Columbia last year \u2013 the deadly heat dome and wildfires that destroyed the village of Lytton, then the \u201catmospheric rivers\u201d in November that led to massive flooding in the B.C. Interior that took out roads and rail lines, and submerged vast agricultural lands.\n\n\u201cSo that tells you something, and it just heightens our efforts. We\u2019ve got to deal with this global problem. We have to do our share and I think our whole culture at Teck is totally committed to this,\u201d he says.\n\nWill ESG emerge intact from its current crisis? Most business leaders say it will, but it is undergoing a shift in thinking. Many predict sustainability will be treated as overarching best practice for all businesses rather than an asset class that competes with others for capital, and that is subject to cyclical swings.\n\nThis is part of what Martin Grosskopf, portfolio manager with AGF Investments Inc., calls ESG 2.0. \u201cWhether it continues to be called ESG, or whether its just assumed what\u2019s in general due diligence in risk management, that remains to be seen,\u201d he says.\n\nInvestments in ESG generate long-term benefits and companies are not likely to dismantle their programs now that they are ingrained in corporate operations and governance. \u201cESG hasn\u2019t disappeared in Europe, It\u2019s not going to disappear from a shareholder rights perspective,\u201d Mr. Slater says. \u201cI think many are finding it\u2019s now part of their culture, part of their road map, and it will continue to be so for a good period of time.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Jones writes about sustainable finance and the ESG sector for The Globe and Mail.
