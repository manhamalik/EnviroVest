From offering secure online retail facilities to guaranteeing the availability of critical healthcare services, it is paramount for all organisations to counter the challenge of cyberattacks in a digital world. Along with developing key technologies that enable resilience across the entire security landscape, Microsoft has also gathered together a community of partners specialising in cyberattack detection and prevention. The Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA), launched in 2018, now comprises well over 300 members, all of which are committed to providing customers with end-to-end secure operations. In our cover story starting on page 42 we talk with MISA lead Maria Thompson, along with Microsoft security leads Vasu Jakkal and Rob Lefferts, about the advances being made in countering the global threat of cyberattack. Since its launch in 2020, the World Economic Forum\u2019s Reskilling Revolution initiative has fundamentally changed the attitudes of organisations when considering the ongoing education and training of their workforces. The need for employers to provide their personnel with better education, new skills and more productive work environments is now essential. This is particularly true in manufacturing, where the adoption of new technology can yield visible impact on established ways of working. In our feature starting on page 130, Microsoft\u2019s Abid Chaudhry shares how tools such as Microsoft 365 and Cloud for Manufacturing are connecting workers in entirely new ways and shaping the future of a rapidly transforming industry. As leaders across all industry sectors explore new ways of working, Microsoft has also taken stock of the changing role of technology in an era of digital transformation. At its State of the Partner Ecosystem presentation in March 2022, vice president for global partner solutions Nick Parker announced the launch of the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program \u2013 the first major evolution of the Microsoft partner programme in 15 years, designed to create new opportunities for partners and customers alike. We take some time to talk further with him about this new partner ecosystem, the ongoing impact of digital transformation on the traditional workplace and Microsoft\u2019s vision for the future of work in a post-pandemic world on page 34.

The act provides companies, service providers and agencies with resources to create competitive integrated employment service delivery models that individuals with disabilities will need. Newly updated accessibility features in Windows 11 include live captions, which are available both online and offline to improve the user experience for those who are hard of hearing or deaf. This allows them to follow events in real time. Meanwhile, screen-reader users have access to new natural voices that can read text to reduce distractions resulting from disjointed computer-generated text. Improvements on voice access and focus mode also contribute towards the extended accessibility of Windows 11, enabling those who struggle to concentrate to use focus mode to disable notifications. In a recent online survey conducted by Wakefield Research on behalf of Microsoft, 84 per cent of the 1,000 US school teachers who participated said that it is impossible to achieve equity in education without accessible learning tools. The updated features in Windows 11 helps to combat this. Microsoft has also launched a line of adaptive accessories, including a kit comprising 3D stickers, port indicators and openers to make it easier for people to find, open and use Microsoft Surface devices. Customisable mouses and keyboards will also be available in autumn 2022. \u201cAccessibility can make content more inclusive, whether or not you know if someone has a disability,\u201d said Jenny LayFlurry, chief accessibility officer at Microsoft, in a blog post to celebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day on 20 May 2022. New accessibility features launched for Windows 11 Operating system enhancements are among the new solutions, accessories and initiatives from Microsoft to help enterprises support people with disabilities and mental health diagnoses Microsoft has launched a line of adaptive accessories to support those with disabilities Photo: Microsoft\n\n17 Microsoft is also encouraging employers to welcome disabled talent by supplying U.S. Department of Labor grants to states and entities to help to transform their business and programme models to support those with disabilities. The Microsoft-led job site, Neurodiversity Career Connector, was set up in May 2022 to help put neurodivergent people in contact with companies that have dedicated hiring programmes. Additionally, Microsoft is using its solutions to help companies to develop accessible platforms for those in need. For instance, CityMaas, an organisation committed to connecting the disabled community, has developed a Mobility Map platform to provide localised accessibility information about businesses and places of interest for disabled communities. Projects such as these employ machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to provide real-time data to empower the disabled community. Microsoft is also collaborating with mental health organisations and charities such as Ksana, Ellipsis Health and Bipolar Buddy to support users with mental health diagnoses. Mental Health America in California, USA, is using AI and machine learning to power an SMS chat service that provides assistance to those who are isolated by offering pushed text messages throughout the day so that users can engage whenever they are ready to. Furthermore, Microsoft recently launched a well-being initiative with Retail Trust to develop and deploy a programme for retail staff that will offer digital tools and content to support retail employees\u2019 physical, mental and financial health and promote happier careers in the sector. Using Teams, Dynamics 365, Azure, SharePoint and Power BI, the services will give retailers a view of their well-being performance and let them compare it with others. It is initiatives such as this which encourages better mental health in the workplace. \u201cTechnology has the power to empower,\u201d said Lay-Flurry. \u201cOur responsibility is to raise the bar for what is possible with technology for people with disabilities and deliver on the potential of inclusive design.\u201d Microsoft has improved its accessibility features on Windows 11, including new natural voices for screen-reader users and voice access\n\n18 MAR K E TWATCH Data management solutions provider AvePoint has launched Ransomware Detection as part of its Cloud Backup for Microsoft 365 offering to further protect digital collaboration data. The new capability proactively detects suspicious behaviour within users\u2019 Microsoft OneDrive environments, while minimising disruption to productivity and collaboration. After detecting unusual activity, Cloud Backup provides detailed reports to reduce investigation time and quickly recover business-critical information. \u201cOur goal is to equip businesses with an easy and reliable way to mitigate the threat of an attack and prevent detrimental data loss,\u201d said John Peluso, chief product officer at AvePoint. AvePoint launches Ransomware Detection Darktrace builds on proactive security offering with Cybersprint acquisition Artificial intelligence security company Darktrace is to launch a new product family \u2013 Darktrace Prevent \u2013 following its acquisition of attack surface management solution provider Cybersprint. According to Darktrace, combining its technologies with Cybersprint\u2019s will enable it to offer organisations continuous and autonomous testing of critical systems, allowing them to assess risk and systemically harden their digital estates. While Darktrace already delivers \u2018inside-out\u2019 visibility into its customers\u2019 internal data, Cybersprint\u2019s attack surface management will enable it to offer an \u2018outside-in\u2019 perspective. This will enhance Darktrace\u2019s existing detect and respond capabilities for customers\u2019 external data. Global identity verification and data quality business Melissa has made major updates to its sanctions list in response to the 2022 conflict in Ukraine.

Working under the management of the GLA Technology Group, Gamma managed the migration of the authority\u2019s phone lines and numbers, and moved its public-facing contact centres to the cloud. Using its Microsoft Teams Direct Routing proposition, Gamma provided connectivity with a public switched telephone network for inbound and outbound calls through its own network, together with a range of additional private branch exchange-like advanced call control features. \u201cI can\u2019t fault Gamma\u2019s service,\u201d said Michelle Hones, senior business analyst at GLA. \u201cThey are one point of contact, and their people are all very knowledgeable, professional and responsive: exactly what you need from a supplier.\u201d Microsoft has introduced a new Microsoft Entra product family, which encompasses all of its identity and access capabilities to help organisations improve cybersecurity. Microsoft Entra includes the already established Azure Active Directory (Azure AD); the new Microsoft Entra Permissions Management, which is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management solution; and Microsoft Entra Verified ID, which is a decentralised identity product offering. Integrated within the Defender for Cloud dashboard, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management provides organisations with visibility into permission for all identities, actions and resources across multi-cloud infrastructures. This allows them to detect excessive permissions and reduce the risk of data breaches. It will be available in July 2022. Meanwhile, Microsoft Entra Verified ID will secure digital interactions whilst respecting users\u2019 privacy, making portable, self-owned identity possible. The platform will allow individuals and organisations to decide what information they share, when they share it and with whom. This will be available in August 2022.

The report outlines how manufacturing organisations can use secure tunnelling to establish bidirectional, real-time connections between their plant or remote facilities and the IT department. \u201cProject managers and control engineers can use this guidance to see how to send their data securely through demilitarised zone network configurations while keeping all inbound firewalls closed,\u201d said Andrew Thomas, president of Skkynet. Accessing live production data can be secure, says Skkynet\n\n21 Fastpath Solutions recently integrated its Access Risk Monitor with Microsoft's Azure Active Directory (AAD) Identity Governance platform. Fastpath identifies separation of duties violations and other access risks within access packages that are created within Entitlement Management, a component of AAD Identity Governance. Fastpath goes deep, looking at user access at the securable object level, so administrators can identify user access risks across multiple business applications before provisioning users. The company also ensures that only minimum access rights are granted to users, an area of focus among auditors and regulators. Frank Vukovits is director of strategic partnerships at Fastpath Solutions Fastpath Solutions integrates risk management with Microsoft VIEWPOINT: FRANK VUKOVITS NSA warns of increased threat of state-sponsored cyberattacks The US National Security Agency (NSA) has warned of an increase of state-sponsored malicious cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure. A joint cybersecurity advisory issued by the agency highlights destructive malware, ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and cyber espionage as specific threats which have the potential to take critical systems offline and even cause physical damage. It recommends that organisations patch all known vulnerabilities as a matter of urgency and suggests that other high-priority defence tactics could include implementing multifactor authentication, securing remote access, and training end users to recognise phishing, spear-phishing, and other attempts at social engineering. Center for Internet Security (CIS) has updated the mappings between its Azure Foundations Benchmark and Azure Security Benchmark to include a collection of high-impact cybersecurity recommendations. The new recommendations can be found in the references section of the CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark. The reference to the Azure Security Benchmark allows users to easily navigate to the guidelines and see the security controls and service baselines. Over 85 Azure services are covered by the service baselines, while the security controls consist of 11 domains included in Azure Security Benchmark v2. Anywhere365 is developing its new Partner Portal, having recently onboarded over 100 partners onto its Partnership Program, which was first launched in April 2022.

Despite this, only one in five are currently able to do so, and although 60 per cent of employees prefer hybrid working, only 39 per cent can. The 2022 edition of the Hybrid Ways of Working global report surveyed 2,800 knowledge workers across six countries worldwide, analysing employee sentiments and motivations around the physical workspace in the hybrid working era. \u201cWe are entering the next stage of the hybrid working journey and employees have seen that a vast majority of them still excel at their jobs regardless of where they are,\u201d said Nigel Dunn, managing director for EMEA North at Jabra. \u201cAt a time when companies are asking for a return to the office, many employees are calling for more power to determine their own work arrangement.\u201d The report showed that employees with full control over their work arrangement unanimously report a higher work experience score than their medium and low autonomy counterparts. These differences are most apparent when it comes to feeling a sense of belonging, productivity, trust in leaders, worklife balance, and mental well-being. \u201cAutonomy will be an essential part of improving employees\u2019 satisfaction and engagement at work and key to stabilising the foundational pillars of organisational culture and success,\u201d said Dunn. The report also highlighted the rise of the \u2018anywhere office\u2019. In fact, 64 per cent of Generation Z consider their office to be their laptop, headset and wherever they can get a strong internet connection. This highlights the growing importance of technology in defining the employee experience. \u201cIn the last two years, what started as a necessary shift to remote working has evolved into the greatest work experiment of all time,\u201d said Dunn. \u201cLeaders should reassess what employees really need to improve the hybrid working experience and how to make this a long-term success. Empower employees to choose where they prefer to work and give them the technology, tools and support to thrive and be productive in any environment.\u201d Read the full report at: www.jabra.co.uk/hybridwork/2022 Choosing where you work from makes you happier, says Jabra\n\n31 Video conferencing and communication solution provider Yealink is joining with Microsoft and several ecosystem partners to hold a series of small regional events across the USA in July and August 2022.

            "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: Cody Slater CEO and Chairman of Calgary based Blackline Safety, which designs and manufactures a line of devices programmed to detect a number of potentially harmful gasses.Glenn Lowson/The Globe and Mail\n\nESG has been part and parcel of Cody Slater\u2019s business from the start. Now, though, with the stock market cratering, ESG \u2013 environmental, social and governance \u2013 has dropped a few notches on the priority list for investors in his company, Blackline Safety Corp., he says.\n\nBlackline manufactures and sells wearable software-enabled sensors used to detect noxious gases that could kill workers. As a safety item, Blackline\u2019s products help a global roster of customers such as Shell PLC and Tyson Foods Inc. bolster their records in the S category \u2013 social. Meanwhile, Calgary-based Blackline has joined countless other companies in putting its own ESG programs into force, including issuing a yearly report on its progress.\n\nThis all remains important, says Mr. Slater, Blackline\u2019s chief executive officer. But the clamour from investors demanding more stringent sustainability programs is being drowned out by a string of global crises, and worries about weakness in financial markets.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a portion of the ESG world that\u2019s always been a bit of a bandwagon I think, and when times are good and everything\u2019s great, it\u2019s easy to talk about and easy to have more focus on,\u201d Mr. Slater says.\n\nNow, it\u2019s not so easy. Amid a tech industry meltdown, Blackline\u2019s share price is down by more than half since the start of the year, even as it was named to the Financial Times list of the 500 fastest growing companies in the Americas.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it changes the fundamental desire from an investor standpoint, but it definitely changes the focus point \u2013 focus is off ESG,\u201d Mr. Slater says.\n\nThe push for sustainability was a massive force in business in the first part of the COVID-19 pandemic, but in 2022, it has come under fire. As Mr. Slater says, market and social turmoil have shifted investor priorities. But ESG has become a battleground with many fronts.\n\nSome politicians and business leaders blame the rush to carbon-free energy as a contributor to surging oil and gas prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine worsened an already-tight global supply situation. In addition, critics say investors in some ESG funds are being misled into believing their money is used to fight climate change and racial inequality when that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nMeanwhile, regulators in Canada and around the world are demanding more stringent disclosure of ESG performance, leading to higher compliance costs for companies. And some of the world\u2019s major banks are under investigation for greenwashing.\n\nAmid this upheaval, CEOs must keep navigating the ESG world alongside all their other responsibilities. Canadian corporations, especially large ones, have implemented extensive sustainability programs, and their boards are responsible for overseeing them. Major institutional shareholders, from pension funds to asset managers such as BlackRock Inc., still want increasing volumes of data on everything from greenhouse gases to gender diversity among directors. For some corporate bosses, a portion of their compensation is even tied to meeting ESG-related goals.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Don Lindsay, CEO of Vancouver-based Teck Resources Ltd.JENNIFER GAUTHIER/https://secure.tgam.arcpublishing.com/composer/edit/CFXXI5KBPNDCLG4SIEYJ6RF2GE/\n\nWith all of this swirling, The Globe and Mail asked CEOs: Can the push to turn businesses into forces for social and environmental good survive in a world of crisis and political polarization? If so, are we headed for a new generation of ESG?\n\nFor Don Lindsay, CEO of Vancouver-based Teck Resources Ltd., his company\u2019s prospects still depend on improving its environmental record. As a copper and zinc miner, its output is prized in renewable energy technology. But Teck also produces steelmaking coal and crude in the oil sands, and both are scrutinized for high carbon emissions.\n\nEven so, Mr. Lindsay sees no turning back from Teck\u2019s sustainability push, which features a recently toughened company target to get to net-zero emissions, and donations of thousands of hectares of land for ecosystem preservation.\n\nIn the weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, some of the company\u2019s investors predicted the end of the push to a transition to a low-carbon global economy. \u201cIt\u2019s on the back burner. It\u2019s all about energy security now,\u201d he says, summing up that attitude.\n\n\u201cBut that changed back pretty quickly when people determined that the way to get energy security is through energy transition,\u201d Mr. Lindsay says. \u201cAnd so I think some of these global events, sad as they are, have actually strengthened the resolve of the world and accelerated the investment in energy transition.\u201d\n\nHe says some of the skepticism that has overshadowed ESG is a reaction to the inexact science of scores that third-party ratings agencies provide for companies \u2013 and which form the basis of some exchange-traded funds. The agencies measure CO2 emissions, climate-related targets, work force diversity and a wide range of other metrics deemed to be material to a business\u2019s risk profile. In many cases, the scores estimate how companies are protected against ESG-related risks more than they show a company\u2019s full impact in the three areas.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Tesla Inc. \u2013 the company credited with turning electric cars into green status symbols \u2013 was dropped from the S&P 500 ESG index in May, much to founder and CEO Elon Musk's displeasure.POOL/Reuters\n\nThe debate burst into the public realm in May, when Tesla Inc. \u2013 the company credited with turning electric cars into green status symbols \u2013 was dropped from the S&P 500 ESG index. Tesla founder Elon Musk tweeted his displeasure with the move: ESG and ratings that measure performance are a \u201cscam\u201d that has been \u201cweaponized by phony social justice warriors,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe company failed to make the cut after its ESG ratings fell because of a number of factors, including its lack of a low-carbon strategy and codes of business conduct, S&P explained.\n\nParticularly galling for Mr. Musk, oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. was added to the index, despite its carbon emissions and years of lobbying against tougher action on climate change. S&P rated Exxon Mobil\u2019s ESG programs as acceptable for its industry.\n\n\u201cIt is complex. There are a great many agencies who are generally self-anointed, who come up with their own formulas for measuring how you\u2019re doing on ESG,\u201d Mr. Lindsay says. \u201cWe do quite well. We\u2019re number one in some indices, number two in the others that are generally highly regarded. But the complexity of all those indices, and everyone having their own priorities, could make you a bit cynical about whether the measurement is valid.\u201d\n\nESG has been a factor in global markets for decades, albeit with different names, including ethical investing, responsible investing and sustainable investing. Companies have become accustomed to issuing annual corporate social responsibility reports to let investors and other stakeholders know about their non-financial priorities.\n\nOver the past decade, the field morphed into an overlay to other corporate performance measures, to be sliced and diced into data highlighting risks and opportunities for companies and their investors. But ESG investing still occupied a niche in finance.\n\nFor the first time in years, more cash was drained from ESG-themed exchange-traded funds than invested U.S.-listed ESG ETF monthly funds flow (US$ millions) $8,000 Broad ESG equity 7,000 Environment and clean energy equity 6,000 Fixed income Other 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 -1,000 May Jan. 2021 May Sept.

With economies forced into lockdown, society in general \u2013 and financial markets in particular \u2013 saw how vulnerable the world is to shocks. Executives and investors took note of how other systemic problems, such as climate change and racial inequality, present major risks that have to be dealt with.\n\nAs the climate crisis has become more acute, the transition to a low-carbon economy emerged as the top focus, forcing energy, transport and mining companies to devise goals to cut carbon emissions. That shift also helped renewable energy and other cleantech startups flourish. For investors, ESG became an asset class unto itself, with money in mutual and other investment funds topping US$2.7-trillion worldwide.\n\nBut this year, a lot of those investments have cratered as jittery markets abandoned long-term growth ambitions and turned attention to the need for investments offering immediate cash flow. In May, U.S. ESG funds suffered their first outflow of money since 2019, says Baltej Sidhu, ESG analyst at National Bank of Canada.\n\nYet the pullback will not change the long-term ESG focus for Manulife Financial Corp.\u2019s asset management arm, Manulife Investment Management, says Paul Lorentz, the unit\u2019s CEO. In fact, nearly all the investment mandates the firm bids on now demand proof of its ESG expertise and performance, Mr. Lorentz says. \u201cIt may vary a little bit by geography, but it\u2019s becoming table stakes now in terms of what investors are expecting or what asset owners are expecting.\u201d\n\nDespite the market turmoil, the insurer\u2019s investment division, which has $860-billion under management, still sees steady demand for investments that reflect more than just profit, he says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much noise out there, but I think what matters is, are they comfortable with the companies that they\u2019re dealing with? Are they really proud of what those organizations are trying to do to their business, to further the agenda?\u201d\n\nSome of that noise has come from politicians and business leaders, especially in the United States. They chafe with the machinations of ESG and its increasingly detailed disclosure and target-setting requirements. Regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Canadian Securities Administrators, are among authorities demanding more reporting on ESG measures while they also vet corporate environmental claims to combat greenwashing. They are facing pushback from many companies and their industry associations.\n\nMajor financial institutions, such as Deutsche Bank\u2019s DWS unit and Goldman Sachs, are under investigation for the veracity of ESG promises in investment funds. In March, the SEC hit BNY Mellon with a US$1.5-million fine for misstatements and omissions.\n\nOn the other hand, inflation and fuel shortages, partly due to international sanctions in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, have pinched consumers and helped fuel skepticism about a shift to green energy.\n\nDarren Gee, CEO of Peyto Exploration & Development Corp., a Calgary-based natural gas producer, said some factions of society fell victim to the belief that the transition to low-carbon energy could be done quickly without having to worry about reliability and affordability. He laments how natural gas is often lumped in with dirtier forms of energy. He says it should be shipped globally to displace coal, as demand for fossil fuels remains.\n\n\u201cI think we were rushing into something without really thinking deeply about it,\u201d Mr. Gee says. \u201cIt\u2019s a rush to try and create a system of governance on the supply. This has no impact on demand. And yet it\u2019s demand that we want to affect. Governments around the world, free societies like North America, where we have institutions that are trying to do what they can are all focused on supplies. None of them are focused on demand.\u201d\n\nThe energy industry has been at the centre of debates over environmental impact for decades. As recently as a year ago, some institutional investors warned Canadian oil and gas producers their access to capital would be cut off unless those companies upped their games on ESG \u2013 specifically carbon emissions. A few pension and university endowment funds, such as the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec and Harvard Management Co., publicized their decisions to divest from the sector.\n\nNow, with the prices of energy commodities at multiyear highs, access to capital is of little concern \u2013 much of the industry has more money than it can spend profitably by increasing production. Instead, companies have paid down debt, raised dividends and bought back shares.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Calgary-based Blackline Safety, which engineers and manufactures safety devices, has joined countless other companies in putting its own ESG programs into force, including issuing a yearly report on its progress.Glenn Lowson/The globe and mail\n\nMr. Gee says ESG has not moved on Peyto\u2019s priority list, even as energy security and prices have blasted to the fore.\n\n\u201cWe as a company have always been extremely focused on efficiency and as a result of being as efficient as we can be, we have traditionally led the industry in our cost structure. We\u2019re the lowest-cost producer,\u201d he says. \u201cThat low cost and that efficiency also flows through to environmental performance. We\u2019re not wasteful and generally the environmental impact is worse when you\u2019re wasteful.\u201d\n\nAs a business concept, ESG has attracted some big-name enemies. Texas legislators passed a law last year that penalizes firms for excluding oil and gas holdings by preventing those firms from doing business with the state\u2019s pension and investment funds. Other states, including West Virginia, are following suit. Former U.S. vice-president Mike Pence has decried ESG regulations that he said \u201callow left-wing radicals to destroy American energy producers from within.\u201d\n\nOne leading light of the \u201cstakeholder capitalism\u201d movement has taken pains to explain he is not some kind of left-wing activist. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc., the world\u2019s largest asset manager, and the man credited with bringing ESG investing into the mainstream, used his annual letter to business leaders in January to send the message that he does not have a \u201cwoke\u201d ideological agenda.\n\n\u201cIt is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper. This is the power of capitalism,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote.\n\nSo far, the U.S. has proved to be more politically polarized on sustainability issues than Canada, Mr. Sidhu says. \u201cMost people in Canada know that our resources are more on the carbon-intensive side, and there is a need for us to at least get it down to a median on the global scale. I think [the backlash] is not going to be as pronounced as we\u2019ve seen it in the States.\u201d\n\nStill, ESG is proving contentious globally as well. In May, Stuart Kirk, who was global head of responsible investment at HSBC Investment Management, made waves when he gave a speech criticizing those who make doomsday predictions about global warming and play up the finance industry\u2019s responsibilities for combatting it.\n\nHis remarks, at the Financial Times\u2019 Moral Money Summit, went viral and prompted the HSBC\u2019s CEO to issue a statement saying they did not represent the views of the British financial giant, which remains focused on net-zero goals. HSBC suspended the 27-year veteran, fuelling a debate over accusations of corporate cancel culture.\n\nMr. Kirk resigned this past week, promising to \u201ccontinue to prod with a sharp stick the nonsense, hypocrisy, sloppy logic and group-think inside the mainstream bubble of sustainable finance.\u201d\n\nAmid the turmoil, the onus remains on companies across industries to live up to their claims and be transparent with their reporting so investors are confident they are putting put their money where it has positive impact, and aligns with global environmental and social goals, Mr. Lorentz says. \u201cUnfortunately there are examples out there where this hasn\u2019t always been the case.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the problems ESG is supposed to address, notably climate change, still exist, and are getting tougher to counteract as the energy crisis persists. This year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said solutions for reducing greenhouse gases are available, but it is an open question whether they can be scaled up quickly enough to meet international commitments and head off the worst impacts of global warming.\n\nMr. Lindsay says there is more than enough evidence. He points to the environmental devastation in Teck\u2019s home province of British Columbia last year \u2013 the deadly heat dome and wildfires that destroyed the village of Lytton, then the \u201catmospheric rivers\u201d in November that led to massive flooding in the B.C. Interior that took out roads and rail lines, and submerged vast agricultural lands.\n\n\u201cSo that tells you something, and it just heightens our efforts. We\u2019ve got to deal with this global problem. We have to do our share and I think our whole culture at Teck is totally committed to this,\u201d he says.\n\nWill ESG emerge intact from its current crisis? Most business leaders say it will, but it is undergoing a shift in thinking. Many predict sustainability will be treated as overarching best practice for all businesses rather than an asset class that competes with others for capital, and that is subject to cyclical swings.\n\nThis is part of what Martin Grosskopf, portfolio manager with AGF Investments Inc., calls ESG 2.0. \u201cWhether it continues to be called ESG, or whether its just assumed what\u2019s in general due diligence in risk management, that remains to be seen,\u201d he says.\n\nInvestments in ESG generate long-term benefits and companies are not likely to dismantle their programs now that they are ingrained in corporate operations and governance. \u201cESG hasn\u2019t disappeared in Europe, It\u2019s not going to disappear from a shareholder rights perspective,\u201d Mr. Slater says. \u201cI think many are finding it\u2019s now part of their culture, part of their road map, and it will continue to be so for a good period of time.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Jones writes about sustainable finance and the ESG sector for The Globe and Mail.

            "article_text": "Global investment leader selects AWS as a preferred cloud provider to gain business insights, improve workplace safety, and automate hydroelectric, wind, and solar operations\n\nBrookfield Renewable agrees to provide clean energy capacity to power Amazon\u2019s operations on three continents\n\nAt AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc., an Amazon.com, Inc. company, announced that Brookfield Asset Management, one of the world\u2019s leading investors in renewable power, has selected AWS as a preferred cloud provider to accelerate its digital transformation and become a more data-driven company in the cloud. Brookfield migrated its legacy systems to AWS and is using AWS\u2019s analytics, containers, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and storage capabilities, as well as AWS\u2019s extensive partner network, to modernize its technology infrastructure, optimize operations, and boost innovation.\n\nIn addition to its agreement with AWS, Brookfield Renewable, a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management and one of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded renewable power platforms, will provide 601.6 megawatts (MW) of clean wind and solar energy capacity to power Amazon\u2019s operations in Europe, North America, and India. In total, these projects are expected to generate 1,370 gigawatt-hours (GWh), which is enough to power more than 120,000 U.S. homes per year.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with Amazon is a tremendously exciting example of companies working together to reach net zero,\u201d said Ruth Kent, chief operating officer at Brookfield Renewable. \u201cAWS is helping us modernize our operational systems, giving us the scalability, reliability, and innovation we need to deliver clean energy around the world. In return, Brookfield Renewable will provide renewable power to Amazon on three continents, which will help Amazon stay on path to power its operations with 100% renewable energy. We look forward to seeing what more this partnership can bring in the future.\u201d\n\nWorking with AWS Professional Services, AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) BDO Lixar, and AWS Partner Databricks, Brookfield Asset Management consolidated 40 petabytes of data in a data lake on AWS to optimize facility operations, increase production output, and improve equipment performance. Applying AWS machine learning and analytics capabilities to this data helps the company automate key aspects of its operations. These capabilities enable Brookfield to proactively manage complex commercial transactions, improve returns on assets, and reduce operating costs. Brookfield Asset Management also uses Databricks\u2019 Lakehouse Platform on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to provide a central data analytics platform that is increasing operational efficiency and reducing costs across more than 10 internal business organizations (including Trading, Risk, Origination, and Operations).\n\nSee related article: Descartes Labs and AWS to Help Organizations Address Sustainability, Food Security, and Climate Change\n\nIn addition, Brookfield Asset Management is implementing improved workplace safety technology, collaborating with AWS and AWS Partner Blackline Safety to provide real-time employee safety monitoring at three hydroelectric dam sites in the U.S. Employees wear Blackline\u2019s G7 wearable safety devices, which rely on Amazon Kinesis (AWS\u2019s service for easily collecting, processing, and analyzing video and data streams in real time) for high-speed streaming data ingestion of location and safety data into the cloud, and Amazon Redshift (AWS\u2019s cloud data warehouse) to detect if an employee is in danger or needs assistance, thereby triggering an alert for supervisors to send help.\n\n\u201cTogether with Brookfield Asset Management, we are advancing the use of renewable energy around the globe,\u201d said Howard Gefen, general manager of Energy & Utilities at AWS. \u201cBrookfield is tapping into the breadth and depth of AWS\u2019s proven global infrastructure, services, and partner community to better harness its data, become more flexible and scalable, and gain better insights into its businesses. In addition, working with Brookfield Renewable will keep Amazon on the path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy while adding more clean energy to grids around the world.\u201d\n\nThe collaboration announced today keeps Amazon on track to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of its original 2030 commitment, and to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. The committed 601.6 MW of power purchase agreements (PPAs) will provide electricity to seven Amazon projects\u2014three in the United States (in Arkansas, Illinois, and Mississippi), three in Europe (in Spain, Northern Ireland, and Italy), and one of Amazon\u2019s first projects in India."
