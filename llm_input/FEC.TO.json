            "article_text": "Frontera Energy Corporation's ( ) investors are due to receive a payment of $0.0625 per share on 16th of April. This payment means the dividend yield will be 3.6%, which is below the average for the industry.\n\nFrontera Energy Might Find It Hard To Continue The Dividend\n\nThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, prior to this announcement, Frontera Energy's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.\n\nAssuming the trend of the last few years continues, EPS will grow by 25.9% over the next 12 months. While it is good to see income moving in the right direction, it still looks like the company won't achieve profitability. However, the positive cash flow ratio gives us some comfort about the sustainability of the dividend.\n\nFrontera Energy's Dividend Has Lacked Consistency\n\nLooking back, Frontera Energy's dividend hasn't been particularly consistent. If the company cuts once, it definitely isn't argument against the possibility of it cutting in the future. Since 2019, the dividend has gone from $0.488 total annually to $0.172. This works out to a decline of approximately 65% over that time. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nGiven that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon. We are encouraged to see that Frontera Energy has grown earnings per share at 26% per year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.\n\nWe Really Like Frontera Energy's Dividend\n\nOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.\n\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

            "article_text": "The EU's focus on penalties rather than incentives for businesses to comply with ESG standards is driving companies to seek more favorable regulatory environments elsewhere.\n\nEuropean oil giants like Shell and TotalEnergies are considering moving their primary listings to the NYSE due to undervaluation in European markets.\n\nStringent ESG regulations in the EU are causing a decline in the competitiveness of European industries compared to their US counterparts.\n\nThe European Union has the world's most rigorous Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) regulations and the most ambitious decarbonization and net-zero targets. But the EU's approach to ESG rules and reporting has too many sticks and few carrots for businesses. European companies are suffocating under numerous EU directives and national laws in bureaucracy that are undermining Europe's competitiveness in many industries, including in green and climate technology.\n\nThe ESG rive has been much stronger in Europe than in the United States, and many European oil companies have felt the growing reluctance of funds and asset managers to invest in the industry. Moreover, new EU directives on corporate ESG and sustainability are additionally burdening all European firms with spending much more on regulatory compliance and reporting than their peers across the Atlantic.\n\nIndustry in Europe is too focused on penalties and not enough focus on rewards to continue doing business in Europe. Industry believes that firms have better chances of doing well in other jurisdictions, primarily in the United States. Valuation Gap\n\nThe ESG movement in Europe has become so strong that some of the top oil firms based in major European economies and listed on European stock markets are reportedly considering moving to a New York listing.\n\nThese include Shell and TotalEnergies, two of the biggest Europe-based oil majors.\n\nReports emerged earlier this year that Shell was considering moving its primary listing to the NYSE. Shell's CEO Wael Sawan said in April that the current location in London is \"undervalued,\" referring to the valuation gap between lower-valued European oil majors and their U.S. peers listed in New York, such as ExxonMobil and Chevron.\n\nTotalEnergies has also aired the idea of a primary listing in New York to attract a larger share of U.S. investors.\n\nUnlike European investors, U.S. investors have resisted the ESG-driven backlash against oil firms, making the U.S. a more attractive option for a primary market of the supermajors.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's estimates, Europe's majors trade at a discount of about 40% to their American rivals. TotalEnergies could have been valued $108 billion higher if it was valued the same way as an average big U.S. oil producer, per earnings multiples calculated by Bloomberg.\n\nCompetitiveness Gap\n\nIt is not only oil executives who feel that their Europe-based firms are undervalued. Many other major companies see the EU regulations as increasingly burdensome, undermining their competitiveness compared to American rivals.\n\nIn the green energy technology sector, even with Europe's most ambitious net-zero goals among all regions, companies find less support and incentives than in the U.S. And some European firms plan more investments in America than in their home markets.\n\nEU regulations, especially on reporting and ESG compliance, are further complicating the business of Europe-based companies.\n\nFor example, the EU's Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence, which entered into force in July, aims to foster sustainable and responsible corporate behavior in companies' operations and across their global value chains. Firms are thus obligated to identify and address adverse human rights and environmental impacts of their actions inside and outside Europe, including in their supply chains.\n\nMoreover, the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), commonly known as the \"carbon border tax,\" was launched on October 1 last year in the first transitional phase for imports of several carbon-intensive groups of products into the European Union. The first phase of the EU's carbon import pricing legislation will not impose levies on the products\u2014such will apply from 2026.\n\nHowever, it is not certain that the carbon border tax would be as effective as it has been designed to be, a new report by Mario Draghi, former European Central Bank President and former Italian Prime Minister, showed on Monday. Draghi was tasked by the European Commission to prepare a report of his personal vision on the future of European competitiveness.\n\nReferring to the carbon border tax, Draghi wrote in the report,\n\n\"While CBAM is an important instrument for European companies to stay competitive against their international peers that face lower or no carbon prices, its success is still uncertain.\"\n\nIn sustainability and industry, \"Europe must confront some fundamental choices about how to pursue its decarbonisation path while preserving the competitive position of its industry. Black-and-white solutions are unlikely to be successful in the European context,\" Draghi said.\n\n\"Most importantly, the \"European Green Deal\" was premised on the creation of new green jobs, so its political sustainability could be endangered if decarbonisation leads instead to de-industrialisation in Europe \u2013 including of industries that can support the green transition,\" according to Draghi.\n\nThe renowned economist and politician also noted that \"innovative companies that want to scale up in Europe are hindered at every stage by inconsistent and restrictive regulations.\"\n\nRegulations, including ESG rules and directives, are impeding European competitiveness, company CEOs said in the latest survey of the European Round Table for Industry (ERT).\n\nThe survey showed in May that business confidence among CEOs and chairs of many of Europe's largest companies has rebounded to the highest level since May 2022. Industry leaders, however, \"are markedly more positive about their companies' business outlook outside Europe than within.\"\n\nWhen asked to point out the highest-impact strategies available to EU leaders to restore competitiveness, an overwhelming 91% of CEOs highlighted that improving and simplifying the EU's regulatory environment would be the most effective policy lever.\n\n\"Across capital investment, employment and sales, CEOs are significantly less optimistic about the future inside Europe than abroad,\" said Sara Murray, Managing Director, International, The Conference Board.\n\n\"CEOs are clear that Europe's hurdles are due to cumbersome regulation, failures to fully integrate the single market, and timidity on technological leadership.\"\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com"

            "article_text": "Listen to this story:\n\nThe agreement provides for the joint development of plants for biomethane produced from organic waste. The first plant, with an expected capacity of up to 100 GWh, will be located at Cepsa\u2019s facilities in Huelva and will be used to produce renewable energy for the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley and the Company\u2019s new second generation biofuels plant\n\nUnder this agreement, Cepsa and PreZero Spain will collaborate in developing initiatives to recover waste and convert it into raw material to produce 2G biofuels and circular chemical products\n\nThe partnership also includes the analysis of solutions designed to decarbonize PreZero Spain\u2019s private land fleet of more than 750 vehicles\n\nCepsa and PreZero Spain have signed a strategic partnership that will enable both companies to advance in their decarbonization objectives. Under the agreement, PreZero Spain will supply biomethane from some of its projects to Cepsa, and the two companies will jointly develop biomethane plants. Furthermore, Cepsa and PreZero Spain will work on the recovery of waste to produce second-generation biofuels and circular chemical products and to decarbonize the land fleet operated by PreZero in Spain and Portugal.\n\nCarlos Barrasa, Executive Vice President of Commercial & Clean Energies at Cepsa, said: \u201cThis alliance with PreZero will allow us to expand access to circular raw materials to produce alternative energies that will facilitate the energy transition, such as green hydrogen and second-generation biofuels. Together we will develop a sustainable alternative for urban and industrial waste processing, recovering this waste for the production of renewable energy and thus promoting a circular and decarbonized economy.\u201c\n\nGonzalo Ca\u00f1ete, CEO of PreZero in Spain and Portugal, added: \u201cThis agreement stems from the enormous potential in Spain for the development of biomethane as a renewably-sourced natural gas, as well as from the need to align ourselves with other EU countries in meeting circular economy and decarbonization objectives. To this end, together with public-private collaboration, we must enhance cooperation between private companies, as demonstrated by this promising partnership that we are announcing today.\u201c\n\nBoth companies are already making progress in the development of a biomethane plant in the province of Huelva. This new facility with an annual capacity of up to 100 GWh, which would cover the heating needs of around 20,000 homes, will be one of the largest installations of this renewable energy in Spain and will be used to produce green hydrogen and renewable fuels. The plant will be built at Cepsa\u2019s facilities in Palos de la Frontera, where the company has an Energy Park and is already building the largest 2G biofuels plant in southern Europe to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel. It also plans to develop a green hydrogen plant with a 1 GW capacity, as part of the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley, at the Energy Park, where it also has a chemical plant.\n\nIn addition, PreZero\u2014which in 2023 produced 75% of all biomethane generated in Spain\u2014will provide Cepsa with this renewable gas, on a preferential basis, in the projects that PreZero and Cepsa identify as strategic for both parties, allowing the energy company and its customers to decarbonize their industrial processes. During its lifecycle, this renewable gas can reduce CO 2 emissions by up to 90% compared to natural gas and has the same characteristics as the latter, which means that it can be stored or fed into the current gas transport network without the need to develop new infrastructure. The agreement will also allow Cepsa to obtain biogenic CO 2 from PreZero Spain\u2019s biomethane plants to produce synthetic fuels.\n\nAs part of this partnership, PreZero will recover other organic waste or used cooking oils for Cepsa to use in producing second-generation biofuels, which will facilitate the immediate decarbonization of sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as heavy road, maritime or air transport. PreZero will also treat plastic waste, including from single-use plastics, to supply Cepsa with the raw material which the energy company can then use to develop circular chemical products. Both companies will analyze the joint development of pyrolysis plants to process this type of non-recyclable plastic waste.\n\nIn addition, Cepsa will research solutions designed to decarbonize PreZero\u2019s private fleet by supplying biofuels or electric recharging, among other initiatives.\n\nCommitment to decarbonization and circularity\n\n\n\nThe production of renewable fuels is in line with the REPowerEU initiative to reduce CO 2 emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, as well as contribute to several of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda: SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production), and SDG 13 (Climate action).\n\n\n\nAs part of its 2030 strategy, Positive Motion, Cepsa is developing an ecosystem to accelerate the decarbonization of its business and that of its customers through the production of green molecules such as renewable hydrogen and its derivatives as well as 2G biofuels including biomethane, PBS or 100% renewable diesel.\n\nRelated Article: BlackRock, Temasek Decarbonization fund invests $69 Million in Neustark for Funding to Expand Carbon Removal Solution Globally\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, PreZero Spain, which currently generates more energy than it uses, aims to be carbon neutral by 2050, reducing greenhouse gas emissions in all its operations. To this end, it has defined a sustainability strategy based on using recycled raw materials, producing green energy, optimizing waste collection routes and loads, and implementing energy efficiency measures, among other actions."

            "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: Lawyer Radha Curpen, the Vancouver-based Group Head of ESG and Sustainability, at law firm McMillan LLP, in Vancouver, on Sept. 20.Jennifer Gauthier/The Globe and Mail\n\nCanada, meet Robby Starbuck.\n\nThe online activist takes credit for pressure campaigns that have prompted multiple U.S. companies to scale back or eliminate their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies and practices. Companies such as Deere & Co., Harley-Davidson Inc., Molson Coors Beverage Co. and Walmart Inc., have all said they\u2019ll change hiring practices, pull out of relationships with equity groups or cut funding for pride parades.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now changed policy at companies worth over US$2-trillion, with many millions of employees who have better workplace environments as a result,\u201d Mr. Starbuck posted Nov. 25 on X, after he said his meeting with Walmart executives prompted a host of changes, including their decision not to extend a five-year, US$100-million philanthropic commitment to fighting systemic racism the retailer made in 2020.\n\n\u201cCompanies can clearly see that America wants normalcy back. The era of wokeness is dying right in front of our eyes. The landscape of corporate America is quickly shifting to sanity and neutrality. We are now the trend, not the anomaly.\u201d\n\nThe Globe and Mail revises 2024 Board Games marking criteria\n\nCanadians might be tempted to dismiss Mr. Starbuck as an anomaly, a product of U.S. culture wars. But he\u2019s one of the most visible faces of a full-scale war on environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies and their subset of DEI practices.\n\nLegislators in Republican-led U.S. states have been fighting ESG investment practices through a series of attacks on their own state treasuries and pension funds. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling killing affirmative action admissions in colleges has prompted lawsuits against private-sector employers for their hiring practices. And with the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, the federal government seems unlikely to stand in the way of any of these assaults.\n\nCanadian companies will find no respite by simply being on the other side of the border. At a minimum, those with U.S. operations must navigate the new American climate.\n\nTo avoid losing business to anti-ESG policies, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal, for example, have had to assure governments in Texas and West Virginia that they do not eschew lending to fossil fuel companies. In the case of BMO, it reversed a previously stated policy that restricted lending to new clients that operate significant coal mines or coal-fired power generation in favour of what it calls a \u201ccomprehensive, risk-based approach.\u201d\n\nThe Globe and Mail\u2019s comprehensive ranking of Canada\u2019s corporate boards for 2024\n\nWalmart\u2019s DEI rollback signals a profound shift in the wake of Trump\u2019s election victory\n\nCan it happen here? It\u2019s easy to say Canada is a far different society, with a far different business culture. But the signs of some tumult are already here, with the population outside Canada\u2019s urban centres restive. Alberta\u2019s ruling United Conservative Party is openly hostile to DEI and climate initiatives, and federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, Canada\u2019s likely prime-minister-in-waiting, repeatedly uses the word \u201cwoke\u201d as a pejorative while promising to undo the signature piece of climate policy produced by the current Liberal government.\n\nIn short, Canadian companies will likely find they need to obscure their ESG and DEI practices with new names, to avoid what have become damaged brands.\n\nBut so far, the results in The Globe and Mail\u2019s Board Games corporate ranking, done in partnership with Toronto consulting firm Global Governance Advisors, do not show a pullback in these policies in 2024 disclosures.\n\nCanadian sustainability board close to issuing first climate-disclosure rules\n\nBoard Games introduced climate disclosure questions in 2023 and expanded them in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, when climate criteria were worth four points of a total score of 100, 13 companies \u2013 or 6 per cent of 219 measured \u2013 received a full score. There were 76 companies that received zero points.\n\nIn 2024, with climate criteria worth nine points, there were 21 companies, about 10 per cent of 215 measured, that received a full score. At the other extreme, however, just 15 companies received zero points.\n\nBoard Games has also ratcheted up its diversity criteria. After long counting the proportion of women on corporate boards, Board Games added criteria for other types of diversity in 2020.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, Board Games devoted 13 points to diversity. In 2023, 19 companies received a full score, and only one company received zero points. There were 53 companies that failed to get at least seven of the 13 points. In 2024, by comparison, 35 received the full 13 points, while none received zero and just 30 failed to get at least seven of the 13 points.\n\n\u201cIn two years we saw probably the most significant change in years in women getting on S&P/TSX Composite Index boards,\u201d said Tony Spizzirri, the partner at Global Governance Advisors who oversees the firm\u2019s Board Games work. Women represent at least one-third of board seats at 79 per cent of companies in the 2024 Board Games on the TSX Index. In 2022, it was at least a third at just 53 per cent of companies. \u201dIt seems many of these companies were also improving diversity in other ways during this time,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn Valley, a partner at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP who co-ordinates the law firm\u2019s extensive annual report on diversity at the Canadian corporate board level, said his firm hasn\u2019t seen a pullback in disclosures or diversity practices in proxy circulars by Canadian companies. \u201cWhether that will change is an open question.\u201d\n\nIn Canada, companies and their investors have so far not faced a high level of opposition to ESG, but their use of the acronym is quickly falling out of favour.\n\nA recent survey of corporate disclosure by Montreal-based consultancy Millani charted steady growth for many years in mentions of ESG by companies in the composite index. Last year, the trend reversed, with just 29 per cent of listed companies referring to ESG, down from 40 per cent the year before. Fifty-three per cent of corporations, meanwhile, used \u201csustainability\u201d instead.\n\nThis stands in stark contrast to the market mania of the early 2020s, when ESG was sold by the investment industry as an asset class unto itself.\n\nMelanie Adams, managing director and global head of responsible investment for RBC Global Asset Management, said \u201cit was almost unfortunate how far the pendulum swung\u201d with attention to ESG because it obscured that the factors underlying it have always been critical for investors. \u201cBecause now it has swung back the other way with the ESG backlash.\u201d\n\nThe picture has been muddied further by Ottawa\u2019s newly enacted anti-greenwashing legislation, which puts companies in legal jeopardy for issuing disclosures that do not live up to scientific scrutiny, said Milla Craig, chief executive officer of Millani.\n\nYet most companies still consider these factors to be key fiduciary duties for their managers and directors. Torys LLP reports that 95 per cent of the companies in the composite index publish some form of ESG, climate action or transition report, and nearly four-fifths include ESG, climate, environmental or sustainability within their board skills matrix. Further, 59 per cent tie executive pay to climate-related targets or metrics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think companies are changing their approach to how they prudently and responsibly manage and oversee risks,\u201d said lawyer Rima Ramchandani, co-head of Torys\u2019 capital markets practice. \u201cBecause of the politicization, some companies are choosing to be more cautious about what they say.\u201d\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Radha Curpen says the political left sees ESG as a vehicle for social outcomes, while the right thinks it fails to maximize shareholder value and means divesting fossil fuels.Jennifer Gauthier/The Globe and Mail\n\nRadha Curpen, the Vancouver-based Group Head of ESG and Sustainability at law firm McMillan LLP, said the political left sees ESG as a vehicle for social outcomes, while the right thinks it fails to maximize shareholder value and means divesting fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of that,\u201d she argues. \u201cESG represents the risks and opportunities that we face today. That\u2019s what it is. The key is governance. How are we going to govern with the changing world? \u2026 We need everything in our tool box to deal with it. We don\u2019t have to call it ESG. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nThe next step will come as Canada decides what to require of public companies for disclosure. The Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB) will soon publish its first set of sustainability and climate-related reporting guidelines. The guidelines will initially be voluntary, but the standards are expected to form the foundation of required disclosure.\n\nThe Canadian Securities Administrators, the umbrella group for the country\u2019s provincial and territorial securities commissions, has said it will study the CSSB standards before issuing rules on what companies will have to disclose. But the CSA has not committed to adopting those standards as is. When the CSA made an initial run at climate disclosure rules, prior to the CSSB\u2019s work, its proposed standards were not as comprehensive or rigorous.\n\nPublic comment on the CSSB standards showed support from institutional investors, but significant pushback from the energy industry, which generally called for less reporting and longer deadlines. Advocates for the CSSB standards fear the CSA will listen to the latter, not the former.\n\n\u201cIt would be unfortunate for the CSA to try to second-guess that process after so many years in the making and say, \u2018Okay, now let\u2019s try and think that through again and see if we can come up with some different compromise,\u2019\u201d said Kevin Thomas, chief executive officer of the Shareholder Association for Research & Education, known as SHARE. The group, which works on behalf of investors, is among the most active pushing for stronger ESG policies.\n\nCSA spokesperson Ilana Kelemen declined to comment until the CSSB standards are issued.\n\nAs regulations and requirements evolve gradually, investors are often taking ESG matters into their own hands. Some, said Dexter John, chief executive officer of Sodali & Co.\u2019s Canadian office, are adopting investment criteria that are more stringent than what proxy advisers such as Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass, Lewis & Co. recommend.\n\nAccording to Sodali & Co., ESG was the focus of 74 Canadian shareholder proposals in the most recent proxy season, up from 50 in 2023. There were just a handful of anti-ESG proposals, largely filed by a small activist group called InvestNow, and they did poorly, with roughly 1 per cent of votes in favour.\n\nIn contrast to climate pressures, DEI initiatives are in their earliest days as a subject of shareholder proposals.\n\nInvestors have pressed companies, including some of Canada\u2019s big banks, to conduct what are called racial equity audits \u2013 examinations of whether policies and procedures support diversity and equity. Toronto-Dominion Bank became the first to release an audit. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, RBC and BMO have all agreed to them, but the latter two banks narrowly defeated shareholder proposals in 2023 calling for them.\n\nFuture shareholder efforts, however, will occur against a backdrop of increasing hostility to DEI in the United States \u2013 and, possibly, Canada.\n\nWhile Mr. Starbuck\u2019s methods garner him attention, much of the anti-DEI work in the U.S. occurred in response to the expansion of the Black Lives Matter that was driven by the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis, Minn.\n\nAcademic think tanks developed campaigns to create ESG and DEI backlash among the public, broadly, and legislators in conservative states, specifically. (One think tank has called BLM funding \u201ca form of reparations made to self-declared enemies of the American nation and way of life.\u201d) After a U.S. Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action at universities, lawsuits against private-sector entities followed.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump was first elected in 2016, disparaging language for anything labelled liberal, progressive or \u201cwoke\u201d became more acceptable, said Dustyn Lanz, chief executive officer of Toronto ESG proxy voting data firm OxProx. He does not think Canada will completely replicate that journey, but he sees similar signs.\n\nMr. Lanz noted that Mr. Poilievre has been deriding progressive ideas as woke. After a riot occurred during an anti-NATO protest in Montreal on Nov. 22, Mr. Poilievre tweeted a response to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying, \u201cThis is what happens when a Prime Minister spends 9 years pushing toxic woke identity politics, dividing and subdividing people by race, gender, vaccine status, religion, region, age, wealth, etc.\u201d\n\nAt the Alberta United Conservatives\u2019 recent annual meeting, Mr. Lanz noted, members booed when someone tried to explain unconscious bias, a core tenet of DEI programs. That showed UCP members \u201cfeel totally comfortable deriding someone in public\u201d for supporting DEI \u2013 and signals Canada is shifting, as well.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Canadian securities regulators are also wrestling with proposals on mandated board-diversity disclosure for public companies. The CSA has put out two competing proposals, which became known as the \u201cOntario\u201d and \u201cWestern\u201d models. The Ontario model, backed by the Ontario Securities Commission, is more prescriptive and lists the diverse groups companies must include in their disclosure. The Western model, backed by Alberta and Saskatchewan, is more narrative and allows companies more freedom to define diversity as they see fit.\n\nThe comment period for the two models ended 14 months ago, and there has been no decision since.\n\nOSC spokesperson Debra Chan said the commission \u201cis working with our CSA colleagues to find a harmonized path forward that meets the needs of our markets. This work is complex and remains a priority.\u201d The CSA\u2019s Ms. Kelemen sent essentially the same statement as the OSC did.\n\nWes Hall, the founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Kingsdale Advisors and the founder of the BlackNorth Initiative, a group that seeks corporate pledges to improve diversity, said if the OSC waits for a CSA decision, \u201cIt will never happen, it just will never. So, in my view, this should be something that\u2019s led by the OSC, and everybody else follow them.\u201d\n\nMr. Hall acknowledges he is concerned about corporate Canada\u2019s commitment to BlackNorth going forward, given the influence the U.S. has on Canadian companies. But, he said, no prominent companies have backed out. \u201cBecause they\u2019re rolling everything back in the States, we should just roll it back here in Canada, too? Why can\u2019t we be the leaders and say no, no, no, that\u2019s not what we stand for in this country?\u201d\n\nIan Robertson, partner with the executive consulting firm Jefferson Hawthorne Group, plans to make advising his clients on the rise of the anti-woke movement in Canada a key part of his business.\n\nMany companies put DEI policies in place reactively, not strategically, he said. Now that they\u2019re under the opposite kind of political pressure, they cannot justify keeping the policies based on a return on investment, said Mr. Robertson, who was formerly chief executive officer of Kingsdale.\n\nOutside of \u201cthe business-hub bubbles of Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver,\u201d Mr. Robertson said, views on a lot of issues in the rest of Canada are very different from the pro-ESG and pro-DEI consensus.\n\n\u201cI would say thinking that we\u2019re not American is not a strategy.\u201d\n\nBoard Games, by the numbers\n\nWomen on boards\n\nWomen represent at least one-third of board seats at 79 per cent of companies in the 2024 Board Games on the TSX Index. In 2022, that was true at just 53 per cent of companies.\n\nBoard diversity\n\nSeventy-three per cent of the Board Games companies explicitly disclose they have at least one board member from a diverse group other than women. Of that, 32 per cent have one board member from a diverse group and 41 per cent have more than one.\n\nClimate expertise\n\nIn 2024, 52 per cent of companies disclosed that climate expertise is a \u201crequired skill\u201d in the board skills matrix and at least one director has that climate expertise. In 2023, that percentage was just 18 per cent.\n\nPerformance pay\n\nPerformance share units (PSUs) make up at least half of the CEO\u2019s long-term incentive grant value at 77 per cent of companies, while 12 per cent of companies do not use PSUs in compensation.\n\nESG in pay\n\nOne-third of the Board Games companies disclose and use quantifiable climate-related metrics in awarding or setting either short-term or long-term incentive-pay plans. Another 44 per cent use some sort of environmental, social or governance metric that isn\u2019t climate-related. Only 23 per cent of companies do not use any at all.\n\nAnnual meetings\n\nOnly 23 per cent of Board Games companies hold a \u201chybrid\u201d annual meeting that allows shareholders to attend either online or in person. The remaining 77 per cent hold a virtual meeting, or an in-person meeting, but not both.\n\nSay on pay\n\nSixty-three per cent of Board Games companies received at least 90-per-cent support from shareholders on their 2023 say on pay non-binding advisory executive compensation resolutions, while 16 per cent fell below that threshold, and 21 per cent did not hold a say on pay vote.\n\nSource: Global Governance Advisors\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this article incorrectly described OxProx as a governance advisory firm. It is an ESG proxy voting data firm. This version has been updated. (Dec. 10, 2024): This article has been updated to correct the spelling of CSA spokesperson Ilana Kelemen's surname."

            "article_text": "Its commissioning will provide a greater guarantee of supply in Spain of this product, made from isopropyl alcohol, which is essential for sanitary disinfection\n\n\n\nIt will be the first plant of its kind in Spain to use green hydrogen and capable of replacing fossil fuels with sustainable alternatives, supporting the company's Positive Motion strategy to drive the energy transition\n\n\n\nThe new plant will have a production capacity of 80,000 tons of isopropyl alcohol and will require an investment of 75 million euros\n\nCepsa continues to develop and diversify its chemicals business by starting the construction of a new isopropyl alcohol (IPA) plant, the first of its kind in Spain. This product is used not only in hydroalcoholic gels, but also in household and industrial cleaning products.The new IPA plant, backed by a \u20ac75 million investment, will be located in Palos de la Frontera (Huelva) and will be the first plant of its kind in Spain to use green hydrogen and capable to replace fossil-based raw materials in the production of isopropyl alcohol with sustainable alternatives. This will expand Cepsa Qu\u00edmica's range of more sustainable products, in line with Cepsa's Positive Motion energy transition strategy.For Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Solana, CEO of Cepsa Qu\u00edmica , the IPA project \u201cis a very important step in our Next Chemicals in Positive Motion strategy. The plant will be linked to our Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley, ensuring that our activities are fully in line with our commitment to advance the fight against climate change and accelerate the ecological transition. It will also strengthen Spain's supply autonomy in these types of products.\u201dThis new plant will guarantee our country consistent and high-quality access to this essential product, which is critical to sectors such as the medical and pharmaceutical industries. It will also reduce our dependence on isopropyl alcohol-based disinfectants from third countries.The Regional Minister of Industry, Energy, and Mines of the Government of Andalusia, Jorge Paradela, emphasized that Cepsa's new chemical plant in Palos is \"a tangible example of how innovation, sustainability, and job creation can go hand in hand, driving economic growth and the well-being of European society.\"\n\nIn Jorge Paradela's words, with this investment by Cepsa, \"it is demonstrated that energy at competitive prices is a factor in industrial location,\" and he highlighted that it will contribute decisively to \"Spain gaining strategic autonomy by being the first facility in the country to produce the raw material for making renewable-origin hydroalcoholic gel.\"Isopropyl alcohol is also used as a solvent in the manufacturing of paints, coatings, and printing inks, as well as an intermediate in the production of key ingredients in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and agrochemical industries.The new facility, scheduled for completion by the end of 2025, will have a production capacity of 80,000 tons per year. It\u2019s estimated that approximately 400,000 hours of work will be required to build this new plant, including both direct and indirect labor.Cepsa's chemical business \u2013 and the new IPA plant \u2013 will benefit from its proximity to the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley and the largest second-generation biofuels plant that Cepsa is building, as part of a joint venture with Bio-Oils, next to the La R\u00e1bida Energy Park in Huelva. The location of the new facility adjacent to the chemical plant and the La R\u00e1bida Energy Park will allow the three facilities to be highly integrated, creating strong industrial and economic synergies. In this regard, it is worth noting that the supply of acetone required for IPA production will come from Cepsa's chemical plant, thus increasing its added value. In addition, the hydrogen (raw material) will be provided by the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley.From the start, the plant will be able to use both renewable energy and raw materials, in line with Cepsa's commitments and the development of its \"Positive Motion\" strategy. The energy supply (thermal and electrical) required for IPA production is thus planned to come from renewable sources.The construction of this new plant will strengthen the new chemical industry in Spain and allow Cepsa to diversify its product portfolio, positioning the company as a leader in the Iberian Peninsula market and making it one of the main producers and references of isopropyl alcohol in the European Union.In this regard, the company has been a global pioneer in the development of more sustainable LAB and phenol, which maintain the same technical properties as the traditional product, but with a lower carbon footprint. These products, called NextLab and NextPhenol, make up this new portfolio (Next), whose production is based on renewable and recycled raw materials and renewable energy use. Cepsa Qu\u00edmica has also developed and validated a certification system for this carbon footprint reduction, complying with international standards in the field."

(GIB.A-T).\n\nSince closing at a record high of $159.66 on March 13, the share price has plunged nearly 13 per cent. Before the market opens on May 1, the company will be releasing its quarterly earnings results. For multiple quarters, revenue growth has been declining. If the company announces disappointing numbers and a muted outlook, this could pull the share price down. However, if there is further price weakness, this may represent a buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nA brief outline on CGI is provided below that may serve as a springboard for further fundamental research when conducting your own due diligence.\n\nThe company\n\nMontreal-based CGI is a leading, global independent information technology and business consulting services firm. The company provides consulting services, technological systems and solutions, and technology servicing outsourced from its clients.\n\nIn terms of geographical revenue breakdown, in fiscal 2023 (ending Sept. 30), 31 per cent was from the U.S., 16 per cent from Canada, 16 per cent from France, 11 per cent from the U.K., 6 per cent from Germany, 6 per cent from Finland, 5 per cent from Sweden, and 9 per cent was from the rest of the world.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, approximately 36 per cent of its revenue stemmed from government agencies.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares are dual-listed, trading on Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker GIB-A, and on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker GIB.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, an institutional investor with a longer-term investment horizon, has an ownership position of approximately 9 per cent.\n\nInvestment thesis\n\nAttractive revenue mix with a material contribution from government contracts.\n\nDiversified geographical and industry exposures.\n\nHigh backlog, which represents future revenue.\n\nHealthy balance sheet with $1.141-billion of cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end.\n\nAcquisition opportunities.\n\nReasonable valuation relative to historical levels.\n\nPotential risk: 1) Decelerating revenue growth. In the first-quarter of fiscal 2024, constant currency revenue growth came in at 1.5 per cent year-over-year. In the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2023, constant currency revenue growth was 2.2 per cent. In the third-quarter of fiscal 2023, constant currency revenue growth was 6.3 per cent. And in the second-quarter of fiscal 2023, constant currency revenue growth stood at 11.4 per cent.\n\nQuarterly earnings and outlook\n\nBefore the market opened on Jan. 31, the company reported in-line quarterly financial results.\n\nRevenue climbed to $3.6-billion, up 4.4 per cent year-over-year or up 1.5 per cent excluding negative currency impacts. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) came in at $584.2-million, up 5.4 per cent year-over-year. The adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2 per cent, down 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Earnings per share, excluding specific items, came in at $1.83, a penny above the consensus estimate, and up 10 per cent year-over-year. Bookings totaled $4.19-billion in the quarter with a strong high book-to-bill ratio of 1.16 times. Backlog stood at $26.57-billion, up from $26.06-billion reported last quarter. In fiscal 2023, return on invested capital was 16 per cent, up from 15.7 per cent reported the prior year.\n\nThe share price increased 0.8 per cent that day on high volume.\n\nOn the earnings call, president and chief executive officer George Schindler signaled conservatism in system integration and consulting (SI&C) spending by commercial clients, \u201cLooking ahead, our overall pipeline for managed services is up year-over-year and sequentially, which we expect will contribute to ongoing bookings strength and future revenue growth. Client demand within the government sector continues to drive strength in our overall pipeline. On a sequential quarter basis, the managed services pipeline for government is up by more than 40 per cent. The pipeline for government SI&C (system integration and consulting) projects is up 20 per cent. We continue to see strong demand related to government priorities for cybersecurity, data analytics and modernization to drive efficiencies and enhance citizen services. While we are beginning to see improving client pipeline for systems integration and consulting across commercial industries, clients continue to exercise caution in their discretionary SI&C spending decisions, given ongoing market uncertainty.\u201d He added, \u201cOur approach is to engage them (commercial clients) in the discussions to prepare for when the spending decisions come. We don\u2019t see them coming yet. I mentioned that in my remarks but we certainly see the pipeline growing. The interest is there but they\u2019re not pulling the trigger quite yet but they are pulling the trigger on the cost utilization, which will only help them to spend more in the back half of the year.\u201d\n\nBefore the market opens on May 1, the company will be releasing its second-quarter financial results. Management will be hosting an earnings call that day at 9 a.m. ET. The consensus earnings per share estimate is $1.95.\n\nReturning capital to shareholders\n\nThe company currently does not pay its shareholders a dividend.\n\nThe company has been actively repurchasing shares as part of its share buyback program. In the first-quarter of fiscal 2024, the company repurchased 874,700 Class A shares at a weighted average price of $133.71.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 recommendations\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, after the company released its first-quarter financial results in January, 13 analysts issued research reports on the company, of which 11 analysts have buy-equivalent recommendations and two analysts have neutral recommendations.\n\nThe firms providing research coverage on the company are: ARC Independent Research, BMO Nesbitt Burns, Canaccord Genuity, CIBC World Markets, Desjardins Securities, Morningstar, National Bank Financial, Raymond James, RBC Dominion Securities, Sadif Investment Analytics, Scotiabank, Stifel Canada, and TD.\n\nRevised recommendations\n\nEarlier this month, two analysts lowered their target prices.\n\nCanaccord Genuity\u2019s Robert Young to $160 from $166.\n\nDesjardins Securities\u2019 Jerome Dubreuil by $2 to $162.\n\nFinancial forecasts\n\nThe Street is forecasting earnings per share of $7.68 in fiscal 2024, up 9 per cent from $7.07 (excluding specific items) reported in fiscal 2023, with earnings per share expected to rise to $8.39 in fiscal 2025.\n\nYear-to-date, earnings expectations declined modestly for fiscal 2024 and remained relatively unchanged for fiscal 2025. For instance, at the beginning of the year, the consensus earnings per share estimates were $7.75 for fiscal 2024 and $8.40 for fiscal 2025.\n\nValuation\n\nThe stock is now trading at a slight discount to its historical average.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 16.6 times the fiscal 2025 consensus estimate, below its five-year historical average of 17.4 times. On an enterprise value-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) basis, the stock is trading at 10.9 times the fiscal 2025 consensus estimate, just below its five-year historical average of 11.2 times.\n\nThe average one-year target price is $161.52, suggesting there is 16-per-cent upside potential.\n\nInsider transaction activity\n\nOn March 11, director Gilles Labb\u00e9 exercised his options, receiving a total of 3,123 shares at an average cost per share of roughly $36.82, and sold 3,123 shares at an average price per share of approximately $156.58, leaving 1,315 shares in this particular account. Net proceeds totaled more than $373,000, excluding any associated transaction fees.\n\nMr. Labb\u00e9 is the former president and chief executive officer of H\u00e9roux-Devtek Inc. (HRX-T) and is currently the executive chairman of the board of H\u00e9roux-Devtek.\n\nOn March 11, executive vice-president, legal and economic affairs, and corporate secretary Benoit Dub\u00e9 exercised his options, receiving a total of 8,000 shares at a cost per share of $48.16, and sold 8,000 shares at an average price per share of approximately $158, after which this specific account did not hold any shares. Net proceeds exceeded $878,000, not including any associated transaction charges.\n\nChart watch\n\nOver the past seven weeks, the share price has collapsed. On March 13, the share price closed at a record high of $159.66. Since then, the share price is down 12.6 per cent, closing at $139.58 on April 29.\n\nGiven the swift decline, the stock has entered oversold territory with a relative strength index (RSI) reading of 30. Generally, an RSI reading at or below 30 represents an oversold condition.\n\nYear-to-date, the share price is down 1.7 per cent, underperforming the S&P/TSX composite index, which is up 5 per cent and relatively in-line with the S&P/TSX information technology sector that is up 0.4 per cent.\n\nLooking at key technical support and resistance levels, the stock price has initial technical support around the $135, $136 levels. There is strong technical support around $130. On a recovery, the share price faces resistance around $150, close to its 50-day moving average (at $150.67). After that, there is a ceiling of resistance around $160, near its record closing high of $159.66.\n\nESG Risk Rating\n\nAccording to risk provider Sustainalytics, CGI has an environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk score of 15.6 as of April 27, 2024. A risk score of between 10 and 20 reflects a \u201clow risk\u201d rating.\n\nThe Breakouts file is a technical analysis screen intended to identify companies that are technically breaking out. In addition, this report highlights a company\u2019s dividend policy, analysts\u2019 recommendations, financial forecasts, and provides a brief technical analysis for a security to provide readers with more information.\n\nIf a stock appears on the positive breakouts list, this indicates positive price momentum, and that a company may be worthwhile for investors to look at the fundamentals in order to determine if the recent price strength is warranted and will continue. If a security appears on the negative breakouts list, this indicates negative price momentum, and may be indicative of either deteriorating fundamentals or perhaps indicates a buying opportunity.\n\nSecurities screened are from the S&P/TSX composite index, the S&P/TSX Small Cap index, as well as Canadian small cap stocks outside of these indexes that have a minimum market capitalization of $200-million.\n\nA technical analysis screen does not replace fundamental analysis, but can help identify companies worth having a closer look at.\n\nThis report should not be considered an investment recommendation"

            "article_text": "Patrick Moore, one of the founders of Greenpeace, said in an email obtained by The Epoch Times that his reasons for leaving Greenpeace were very clear: \u201cGreenpeace was \u2018hijacked\u2019 by the political left when they realized there was money and power in the environmental movement. [Left-leaning] political activists in North America and Europe changed Greenpeace from a science-based organization to a political fundraising organization,\u201d Moore said.\n\nMoore left Greenpeace in 1986, 15 years after he co-founded the organization.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018environmental\u2019 movement has become more of a political movement than an environmental movement,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are primarily focused on creating narratives, stories, that are designed to instill fear and guilt into the public so the public will send them money.\u201d\n\nHe said they mainly operate behind closed doors with other political operatives at the U.N., World Economic Forum, and so on, all of which are primarily political in nature.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] is \u201cnot a science organization,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a political organization composed of the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program.\n\n\u201cThe IPCC hires scientists to provide them with \u2018information\u2019 that supports the \u2018climate emergency\u2019 narrative.\n\nTheir campaigns against fossil fuels, nuclear energy, CO2, plastic, etc., are misguided and designed to make people think the world will come to an end unless we cripple our civilization and destroy our economy. They are now a negative influence on the future of both the environment and human civilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, the left has adopted many policies that would be very destructive to civilization as they are not technically achievable. Only look at the looming energy crisis in Europe and the UK, which Putin is taking advantage of. But it is of their own making in refusing to develop their own natural gas resources, opposing nuclear energy, and adopting an impossible position on fossil fuels in general,\u201d Moore wrote.\n\nThe Left \u2018Hijacked\u2019 Greenpeace\n\nHe said \u201cgreen\u201d for the environment and \u201cpeace\u201d for the people were the organization\u2019s founding principles, but peace was largely forgotten, and green had become the sole agenda.\n\n\u201cMany [so-called] \u2018environmental\u2019 leaders were now saying that \u2018humans are the enemies of the Earth, the enemies of Nature.\u2019 I could not accept that humans are the only evil species. This is too much like \u2018original sin,\u2019 that humans are born with evil, but all the other species are good, even cockroaches, mosquitos, and diseases,\u201d Moore argued.\n\nHe said the new dominant philosophy is that the world would be better if fewer people existed.\n\n\u201cBut the people who said this were not volunteering to be the first to go away. They behave as if they are superior to others. This kind of \u2018pride\u2019 and \u2018conceit\u2019 is the worst of the Cardinal Sins,\u201d Moore said.\n\nEnvironmental Activist\n\nAs a prominent scholar, ecologist, and long-time leader in the international environmental field, Patrick Moore is widely regarded as one of the world\u2019s most qualified experts on the environment. He is also a founder of Greenpeace, the world\u2019s largest environmental activist organization.\n\nMoore received his Ph.D. in Ecology from the University of British Columbia in 1974 and an Honorary Doctorate of Science from North Carolina State University in 2005.\n\nHe co-founded Greenpeace in 1971 and served as president of Greenpeace Canada for nine years. From 1979 to 1986, Moore served as the Director of Greenpeace International, a driving force shaping the group\u2019s policies and directions. During his 15-year tenure, Greenpeace became the world\u2019s largest environmental activist organization.\n\nIn 1991, Moore founded Greenspirit, a consultancy focusing on environmental policies, energy, climate change, biodiversity, genetically modified food, forests, fisheries, food, and resources.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2012, Moore served as co-chairman of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, a U.S.-based environmental advocacy group.\n\nIn 2014, he was appointed Chairman of Ecology, Energy, and Prosperity of Frontier Centre for Public Policy, a non-partisan Canadian public policy think tank.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, Moore served as the Chair of CO2 Coalition, a U.S.-based nonprofit environmental advocacy group dedicated to disputing false claims on CO2 as relates to climate change.\n\nFalse Narrative on Chlorine\n\n\u201cAt the time I decided to leave Greenpeace, I was one of 6 Directors of Greenpeace International. I was the only one with formal science education, BSc Honors in Science and Forestry, and Ph.D. in Ecology. My fellow directors decided that Greenpeace should begin a campaign to \u2018Ban Chlorine Worldwide.\u2019\u201d\n\nMoore said it is true that elemental chlorine gas is highly toxic and was used as a weapon in World War I. However, chlorine is one of the 94 [naturally-ocurring] elements on the Periodic Table and has many roles in biology and human health. For example, table salt (NaCl or Sodium Chloride) is an essential nutrient for all animals and many plants. It is impossible to \u201cban\u201d NaCl.\n\nHe pointed out that adding chlorine to drinking water, swimming pools, and spas was one of the most significant advances in public health history in preventing the spread of water-borne communicable diseases such as cholera. And about 85 percent of pharmaceutical drugs are made with chlorine-related chemistry, and about 25 percent of all our medicines contain chlorine. All halogens, including chlorine, bromine, and iodine, are powerful antibiotics; without them, medicine would not be the same.\n\n\u201cGreenpeace named chlorine \u2018The Devil\u2019s Element\u2019 and calls PVC, polyvinyl chloride, or simply vinyl, \u2018the Poison Plastic.\u2019 All of this is fake [and] to scare the public. In addition, this misguided policy reinforces the attitude that humans are not a worthy species and that the world would be better off without them. I could not convince my fellow Greenpeace directors to abandon this misguided policy. This was the turning point for me,\u201d Moore said.\n\nFalse Narrative on Polar Bears\n\nWhen asked how Greenpeace utilizes its massive donations, Moore said it was used to pay for \u201ca very large staff\u201d (likely over 2,000), extensive advertisements, and fundraising programs. And virtually all of the organization\u2019s ads for fundraising are based on false narratives, which he had thoroughly disproven in his books, one example being the polar bears.\n\n\u201cThe International Treaty on Polar Bears, signed by all polar countries in 1973, to ban unrestricted hunting of polar bears, is never mentioned in the media, Greenpeace, or politicians who say the polar bear is going extinct due to melting ice in the Arctic. In fact, the polar bear population has increased from 6,000 to 8,000 in 1973 to 30,000 to 50,000 today. This is not disputed,\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u201cBut now they say the polar bear will go extinct in 2100 as if they have a magic crystal ball that can predict the future. In fact, this past winter in the Arctic saw an expansion of ice from previous years, and Antarctica was colder during the last winter than in the past 50 years.\u201d\n\nMoore said that he does not pretend to know everything and predict the future with confidence like many in the \u201cclimate emergency\u201d business claim they can do.\n\nThe Goal of the \u2018Environmental Apocalypse\u2019 Theory\n\n\u201cI believe the human population has always been vulnerable to people who predict doom with false stories,\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u201cThe Aztecs threw virgins into volcanos, and the Europeans and Americans burned women as witches for 200 years claiming this would \u2018save the world\u2019 from evil people. This has been [referred to as] \u2018herd mentality,\u2019 \u2018groupthink,\u2019 and \u2018cult behavior.\u2019 Humans are social animals with a hierarchy, and it is easiest to gain a high position by using fear and control.\u201d\n\nMoore said the environmental apocalypse theory is mostly about \u201cpolitical power and control,\u201d adding that he is dedicated to showing people that the situation is not as negative as they are told.\n\n\u201cToday, in the richest countries, our descendants are making decisions that our grandchildren will have to pay for,\u201d he said. \u201cPredictions that the world is coming to an end have been made for thousands of years. Not once has this come true. Why should we believe it now?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are naturally afraid of the future because it is unknown and full of risks and difficult decisions. I believe there is also an element of \u2018self-loathing\u2019 in this apocalypse movement.\u201d\n\nMoore said the young generation today is taught that humans are not worthy and are destroying the earth. This indoctrination has made them feel guilty and ashamed of themselves, which is the wrong way to go about life.\n\nThe Demonization of Carbon Dioxide\n\n\u201cVery few people believe the world is not warming. The record is clear that the world has been warming since about the year 1700, 150 years before we were using fossil fuels. 1700 was the peak of the Little Ice Age, which was very cold and caused crop failures and starvation. Before that, around 1000 A.D. was the Medieval Warm period when Vikings farmed Greenland. [And] before that, around 500 A.D. were the Dark Ages, and before that, the Roman Warm Period when it was warmer than today, and the sea level was 1\u20132 meters higher than today,\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u201cEven until about 1950, the amount of fossil fuel used and CO2 emitted were very small compared to today. We do not know the cause of these periodic fluctuations in temperature, but it was certainly not CO2.\u201d\n\nMoore clarified that the \u201cminority opinion\u201d is not about the history of the Earth\u2019s temperature, but it is the relationship between the temperature and CO2 that is at the center of the dispute.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, I agree that many believe CO2 is the main cause of warming. CO2 is invisible, so no one can actually see what it is doing. And this \u2018majority\u2019 are mainly scientists paid by politicians and bureaucrats, media making headlines, or activists making money. [The rest are] the public who believe this story even though they can\u2019t actually see what CO2 is doing,\u201d Moore said.\n\nMoore provided a graph of temperature continuously measured over 350 years (from 1659 to 2009) in central England. \u201cIf carbon dioxide was the main cause of warming, then there should be a rise in temperature along the carbon dioxide curve, but it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he explained.\n\nMoore described the demonization of CO2 as \u201ccompletely ridiculous.\u201d He added that CO2 is the basis of all life on Earth and its concentration in the atmosphere today, even with the increase, is lower than it has been for a large majority of life\u2019s existence.\n\nRising CO2 Correlates With Increased Plantation: Study\n\nA study in 2013 found that increased levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) have helped boost green foliage across the world\u2019s arid regions over the past 30 years.\n\nThe Australian government agency CSIRO conducted the research in collaboration with Australian National University (ANU). The data was based on satellite observations from the year 1982 to 2010 across parts of the arid areas in Australia, North America, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nIt found an 11 percent increase in foliage cover in the studied area due to what\u2019s called \u201cCO2 fertilization.\u201d\n\nThe study said a fertilization effect occurs when elevated CO2 levels enable a leaf during photosynthesis\u2014the process by which green plants convert sunlight into sugar\u2014to extract more carbon from the air or lose less water to the air or both.\n\n\u201cIf elevated CO2 causes the water use of individual leaves to drop, plants in arid environments will respond by increasing their total numbers of leaves. These changes in leaf cover can be detected by satellite, particularly in deserts and savannas where the cover is less complete than in wet locations,\u201d according to Randall Donohue, the CSIRO research scientist.\n\nBreaking the Global Warming Narrative\n\n\u201cClimate alarmists prefer to discuss climate knowledge only since 1850. The time before this they referred to as the pre-industrial age. This \u2018pre-industrial age\u2019 was more than 3 billion years when life was on the Earth. Many climate changes [occurred during that period], including Ice Ages, Hothouse Ages, major extinctions due to asteroid impacts, and other unknown causes,\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u201cToday, the Earth is in the Pleistocene Ice Age, which began 2.6 million years ago. \u2026 So, the most recent major glaciation, which peaked 20,000 years ago, was not the end of the Ice Age. We are still in the Pleistocene Ice Age no matter how the climate alarmists wish to deny this.\u201d\n\nHe said the great irony of the present panic about the climate is that the Earth is colder today than it was for 250 million years before the Pleistocene Ice Age set in. And CO2 is lower now than in more than 95 percent of Earth\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cBut you would never know this if you listen to all the people who benefit from the lie that the Earth will soon be too hot for life and that CO2 will become higher than in Earth\u2019s history,\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u2018More CO2 Is Beneficial to the Environment and Humans\u2019\n\nAccording to Moore, nearly all commercial greenhouse farmers worldwide buy CO2 to inject into their greenhouses to realize up to 60 percent higher crop yields.\n\n\u201cI was impressed when flying over South Korea [and seeing] how many greenhouses there are in the valleys. Like British Columbia, Korea has a lot of mountains and not so much flat fertile farmland.\n\n\u201cI am sure the greenhouse farmers are putting more CO2 in their greenhouses, up to double and triple what it is in the atmosphere today. This is because nearly all plants growing outside in the natural atmosphere are starved for CO2, and it is what limits them from growing faster,\u201d Moore added.\n\n\u201cPlease refer to the chapter titled \u2018Climate of Fear and Guilt\u2019 in my book, [Fake Invisible Catastrophes and Threats of Doom], if you wish to gain a full understanding of these facts,\u201d he said.\n\nMoore said that most environmental activists, politicians, and so-called experts know that we cannot stop increasing the use of fossil fuels or reducing CO2 emissions within their proposed schedule.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, while attending the COP (Conference of the Parties) in Paris, I offered a public bet for $100,000 in a broadcast media release which went out on more than 200 media feeds, that by 2025 global CO2 emissions would be higher than in 2015. I did not receive one taker, not even from the \u2018greens,\u2019\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u201cI know that more CO2 is entirely beneficial to both the environment and human civilization. I am proud to be a director of the CO2 Coalition.\u201d\n\nThe Irony of \u2018Carbon Neutrality\u2019\n\nMoore said \u201ccarbon neutrality\u201d is a political term, not a scientific one.\n\n\u201cIt is simply wrong to call CO2 \u2018carbon.\u2019 Carbon is an element that is what diamonds, graphite, and carbon black (soot) are composed of. [And] CO2 is a molecule that contains carbon and oxygen and is an invisible gas that is the primary food for all life. [Likewise], it is incorrect to refer to NaCl (table salt) as \u2018chlorine,\u2019 even though NaCl contains chlorine,\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u201cHe said when elements (atoms) combine with each other to form compounds (molecules), they always have very different properties than the elements they are made from.\n\n\u201c\u2018Net-Zero\u2019 is also a political term made-up by activists who are not scientists. For example, the top leaders of this crusade are people like Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Greta Thunberg, none of whom are scientists.\u201d\n\nAccording to Moore, Russia, China, and India are 40 percent of the human population, and they do not agree with this anti-fossil fuel agenda.\n\n\u201cIf we add Brazil, Indonesia, and most African countries, it is a majority of the population who are not climate fanatics,\u201d Moore added.\n\n\u201cAnother great irony is that many countries with the coldest climates, such as Canada, Sweden, Germany, and the UK, are the most concerned about warming. For example, the average annual temperature in Canada is -5.35 degrees Celsius.\u201d\n\nMoore also said that fumes from engines are not CO2; they are other substances, as CO2 is invisible and odorless. Dust is also not CO2; it is soot and can be controlled with present technology. And coal plants built today are much cleaner than ones built 20 years ago.\n\n\u2018Wind and Solar Power Are Parasites on the Economy\u2019\n\n\u201cSolar and wind power are both very expensive and very unreliable. It is almost like a mental illness that so many people have been brainwashed to think entire countries can be supported with these technologies,\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u201cI believe wind and solar energy are parasites on the larger economy. In other words, they make the country poorer than if other more reliable and less costly technologies were used.\u201d\n\nMoore said that wind and solar providers rely heavily on government subsidies, tax write-offs, and mandates, where citizens are forced to buy wind and solar power even if it is more expensive, on the pretext that it is \u201cenvironmentally friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cMillions of people pay more for wind and solar energy while a few people make millions of dollars, marks, pounds, etc. It is a bit like a Ponzi scheme in the stock markets,\u201d Moore added.\n\n\u201cThey require vast areas of land, are not available most of the time, and require reliable energy such as nuclear, hydroelectric, [coal, and natural] gas to be available when wind and solar are unavailable.\u201d\n\nAccording to Moore, the construction of wind and solar farms uses vast amounts of fossil fuels for mining, transportation, and construction. And in many locations, they don\u2019t produce nearly enough energy in their lifetimes as is required to build and maintain them.\n\n\u201cWhy not use reliable energy [such as nuclear, hydroelectricity, natural gas, etc.] as the primary source?\u201d Moore questioned, adding if that were the case, \u201cthen wind and solar would be unnecessary.\u201d\n\n\u2018Plastic Is Not a Toxic Substance\u2019\n\n\u201cPlastic is not a toxic substance. That is why we package and wrap our food in it, to prevent it from becoming contaminated. Plastic does not magically become toxic when it enters the ocean,\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u201cOf course, they say on one hand that plastic will never break down, and then, on the other hand, they say it will quickly decay into \u2018microplastics,\u2019 which, of course, are conveniently invisible so no one can observe or verify this for themselves. How clever!\u201d\n\nAccording to Moore, our digestive system can tell the difference between \u201cfood\u201d and plastic or tiny particles of sand. Our body does not ingest sand into our bloodstream, no matter how microscopic the sand is.\n\nHe said plastic floating in the ocean is like a tiny floating reef, the same as driftwood. It provides a surface for marine species to lay their eggs on, attach themselves to, and eat things that are attached to it.\n\n\u201cPollution is usually toxic or causes harm to life. Plastic is simply \u2018litter\u2019 beside the road. It is not hurting anything. One exception is discarded fishing nets, not because they are plastic but because they are shaped to catch fish. The environmental community should work with the fishing industry to stop throwing damaged nets in the sea and bring them back to the dock, where they can be recycled, used in a waste-to-energy plant, or discarded safely,\u201d Moore added.\n\nThis interview is a compilation of an email exchange between Moore and South Korean Professor Seok-soon Park, professor of environmental science and engineering at Ehwa Womans University in Seoul, South Korea, in November of 2021. It was provided to The Epoch Times by Park with the permission of Moore on July 7, 2022.\n\nBoth he and Moore are among the 1,100 scientists and professionals that signed the World Climate Declaration (WCD), stating that there\u2019s no climate emergency.\n\nProfessor Park is a World Climate Declaration Ambassador at CLINTEL and a member of the CO2 Coalition. He translated \u201cInconvenient Facts: The Science That Al Gore Doesn\u2019t Want You to Know (by Gregory Wrightstone)\u201d and \u201cFake Invisible Catastrophes and Threats of Doom (by Patrick Moore)\u201d into Korean. Deeply impressed by these books, he founded the \u201cKorea Alliance of Freedom and Environmental Groups,\u201d dedicated to enlightening people on the truth of climate change, the eco-friendliness of nuclear power energy, the environmental advantage of a liberal democratic market economy, and sensible environmentalism.\n\nPark received his B.S. in Zoology from Seoul National University (Seoul, Korea) in 1980 and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Environmental Science from Rutgers University (New Brunswick, New Jersey) in 1983 and 1985. Before joining as one of the founding professors at Ewha\u2019s Environmental Science and Engineering Department in 1996, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Rutgers University, visiting professor at Princeton University, and a tenured professor at Kangwon National University (Chuncheon, South Korea).\n\nHe served as the President of the Korean Society of Environmental Education, President of the National Institute of Environmental Research, and a Presidential Advisory Committee member on Science and Technology. He has published over 150 research papers in peer-reviewed journals and has written more than 20 books. He received the Best Scientist and Engineer Award from Korea Science Foundation in 2007 and a Presidential Commendation in 2013.\n\nOriginal Article: EXCLUSIVE: Greenpeace Founder Patrick Moore Says Climate Change Based on False Narratives\n\nAuthor: Lee Yun-Jeong\n\nReprinted with Permission from The Epoch Times (www.theepochtimes.com)"
