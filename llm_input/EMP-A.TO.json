This marks another important step in our ESG journey, as we pursue our growth strategy and seek to create sustainable value for our stakeholders,\u201d said Neil Rossy, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n\u201cThe conversion to sustainability-linked credit facilities is a concrete example of Dollarama\u2019s continued efforts to meaningfully integrate our ESG strategy and commitments into everyday decision-making, including in the active management of our capital structure,\u201d said J.P. Towner, Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThe SLL is tied to two specific sustainability performance targets (\u201cSPTs\u201d) related to the Corporation\u2019s overall Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) strategy and which are linked to incentive pricing terms, namely: 1) Climate Change and Energy Management: Reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity; and 2) Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: Increase of female gender representation in management positions.\n\nRBC Capital Markets (\u201cRBC\u201d) and CIBC acted as Co-Sustainability Structuring Agents.\n\nConcurrently, Dollarama extended the term of each syndicated credit facility and upsized the credit available under all facilities to C$1,050 million, from C$800 million. The term of each facility was extended by one year, with Facility A now maturing on July 5, 2027, Facility B and Facility C maturing on July 5, 2025, and Facility D maturing on July 5, 2023. Under certain circumstances and subject to receipt of additional commitments from existing lenders or other eligible institutions, the Corporation may request increases to committed facilities up to an aggregate amount, together with all then-existing commitments, of C$1,500 million. RBC and CIBC acted as Joint Bookrunners on the extension and upsizing of the credit facilities.\n\nSee related article: Nexus Robotics Receives $2.6 Million In Grant Funding From Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC)\n\nUpsize of U.S. Commercial Paper Program\n\nThe Corporation also announced today the upsize of its commercial paper program in the United States (the \u201cUS Commercial Paper Program\u201d) from US$500 million to US$700 million.\n\nUnder the terms of the US Commercial Paper Program initially launched in February 2020, the Corporation may issue, from time to time, on a private placement basis, unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities not in excess of 397 days from the date of issue (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding at any one time under the US Commercial Paper Program, as amended, will not exceed US$700 million. The Corporation intends to continue to use the proceeds from the issuance of Notes for general corporate purposes.\n\nThe Notes are direct unsecured obligations of the Corporation and rank equally with all of its other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by Dollarama L.P. and Dollarama GP Inc., each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s upsized credit facilities will continue to serve as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of the Notes issued under the US Commercial Paper Program.\n\nThe Notes have not been and will not be qualified for sale to the public under applicable securities laws in Canada and may not be offered or sold to any resident of Canada.\n\nThe Notes offered under the US Commercial Paper Program have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes in the United States or any jurisdiction where it is unlawful to do so.\n\nSource:"

All publicly traded companies need ambitious climate action plans today \u2013 the climate crisis demands it. Climate action is not just for energy producers.\"\n\nDollarama is exposed to significant operational, financial and regulatory risks associated with climate change. Although the company has acknowledged that climate-related weather events can disrupt logistics, and that rising fuel prices will increase operational costs, it has not assessed and managed these risks through adequate targets and timelines that reduce their risk exposure.\n\nDollarama has a goal to reduce its scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by 25 per cent by 2030, but this goal is not aligned with climate-science, nor with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. Furthermore, Dollarama has no 2050 target nor any time-bound commitment to disclose and reduce scope 3 emissions, which likely constitute an overwhelming majority of the company's emissions.1\n\n\"Peer companies continue to make net zero commitments. Dollar Tree announced it will be setting a science-based net zero target by June of next year while growing at a significantly faster pace than Dollarama, which has cited growth ambition as a key barrier to setting science-based targets,\" de Weerdt says. The company opened 65 stores last year, compared to Dollar Tree's 464 store openings. \"By reporting emissions and 1.5\u00b0C-aligned reduction targets across all relevant emissions scopes, Dollarama can provide investors with assurance that leadership is appropriately reducing the company's climate footprint and addressing the growing risks associated with climate change.\"\n\nWith more than 1,400 stores across Canada, Montreal-based Dollarama is the country's largest dollar store retail chain. As such, it can play a major role in Canada's climate efforts and in setting an example for other retailers, all while improving its own reputation and long-term risk exposure.\n\nSHARE offers a guide for corporate climate action plans and is part of a global network of investor interest that seeks to ensure public issuers adopt meaningful emissions reduction targets and the climate plans to back them up.\n\nAbout:\n\nSHARE is an award-winning non-profit organization dedicated to mobilizing investor leadership for a sustainable, inclusive and productive economy. It does this by supporting its investor network and amplifying their voices to improve corporate sustainability practices and implement better rules and regulations that govern capital markets.\n\nFor more information on SHARE, visit www.share.ca.\n\nBackground:\n\nScientific evidence, as presented the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, shows greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C to prevent the worst consequences of climate change and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nSHARE represents a large network of Canadian asset owners including foundations, Indigenous trusts, universities and other asset owners that are committed to responsible investment and has $90 billion in assets under management. SHARE and its clients share the position that the risk of not acting on climate is too high for the planet and for their investments.\n\nSHARE developed a Climate Action Plan guide as a resource for companies, investors and public issuers that outlines minimum expectations for companies to set and achieve emissions reduction targets.\n\nA good plan includes the following:\n\nThe company has both short- and long-term emissions reduction targets; i.e., 2030 and 2050, and provides for third-party emissions verification of targets. The company describes its emissions mitigation hierarchy and reliance on carbon offsets, credits and unproven or commercially unavailable technologies. The plan shows how the company is reducing emissions toward net-zero in its operations and products. Climate expertise at a high level in the company. Compensation is tied to the plan. It includes annual public reports on the plan and targets. Political Lobbying is aligned with a company's decarbonization efforts. Direct and indirect lobbying efforts are fully disclosed annually.\n\n___________________________\n\n1 Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from a company's operations. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the energy a company buys and uses. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions created in the supply chain, from production to use by consumers. Scope 3 emissions are the most difficult to address but make up most of a company's carbon footprint.\n\nSOURCE SHARE (The Shareholder Association for Research and Education)\n\nJennifer Story, Director, Education and Advisory Services, C: +1 416.461.6310, [email protected]"

            "article_text": "Class action plaintiffs are becoming more creative in their search for credible damages claims in relation to consumer products they believe have been manufactured, designed, or sold in a manner inconsistent with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) obligations or expectations. Recent cases in the U.S. and Canada paint a picture of an emerging and evolving landscape of consumer protection class actions which focus on ESG issues.\n\nConsumer protection class actions in the U.S.\n\nThe United States is a hotbed for consumer class actions involving ESG claims. A popular flavour of these cases involves \u201cgreenwashing\u201d claims, which use consumer protection prohibitions on false and misleading statements as a vehicle for seeking damages for inflated statements about corporations\u2019 sustainability practices.\n\nFor instance, in Earth Island Institute v. The Coca-Cola Company, the D.C. Court of Appeals recently overturned a lower court decision which had dismissed at the pleadings stage a proposed class action alleging that public statements made online by Coca-Cola about its sustainability initiatives constituted false and deceptive marketing because it uses single-use, non-recyclable plastics in its packaging1. The appellate court reinstated the case, holding that aspirational statements alleged to be misleading in the aggregate (even ambiguous ones which are not contained within a single statement) can be plausibly actionable under D.C.'s consumer protection law. Coca-Cola provides the latest example of industry groups and consumers seeking redress for allegedly misleading ESG statements.\n\nThe trend arrives in Canada\n\nESG-focused consumer protection class actions are relatively novel in Canada despite a more plaintiff-friendly class action landscape.\n\nCases similar to Coca-Cola have only recently started to crop up in Canadian courts. The Superior Court of Qu\u00e9bec recently authorized a class action against Dollarama on the basis that the reusable bags sold at checkout are labelled \u201crecyclable\u201d, when it is alleged that they are not, in fact, recyclable anywhere in Qu\u00e9bec2. In another example, proposed class actions are also pending against Keurig before the Federal Court and in Ontario and British Columbia, alleging its K-Cup coffee pods are not recyclable despite being marketed to consumers as though they are (for more on the Matter of Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc., read \u201cGreenwashing\u201d and disclosure liability under securities law: two views)3.\n\nScrutiny of international labour practices has also been targeted by ESG-centred class action litigation in Canada. In a proposed B.C. class action, Leaf v. Hershey Canada Inc., plaintiffs are seeking to certify a claim that various Hershey companies are misrepresenting their opposition to the use of child labour and slavery in the cocoa supply chain, despite allegedly facilitating and profiting from those activities4. Although the claim against the U.S.-based Hershey Company was dismissed on a jurisdictional challenge\u2014and due to the plaintiff\u2019s failure to plead that the U.S. entity made misrepresentations to Canadian consumers5\u2014the claim is continuing against the other Hershey defendants.\n\nImplications for advancing consumer claims\n\nFraming ESG claims as misrepresentation class actions under consumer protection statutes is an attractive option for plaintiffs given (1) the broad interpretation of merchants\u2019 obligations under those statutes; and (2) the low bar for class action certification and authorization in many Canadian jurisdictions. Compounding this problem for businesses, Hershey shows that in some cases Canadian entities can be sued in misrepresentation claims in Canada for misconduct carried out by their foreign affiliates. However, there are serious questions as to whether these kinds of cases lead to actual consumer redress, or serve only to draw attention to the plaintiffs\u2019 issues of concern.\n\nWhile we anticipate an uptick in the number of ESG-related consumer claims in Canada, it is not clear how plaintiffs would ultimately prove causation or the quantum of damages allegedly suffered by Canadian consumers in this type of claim. This lack of clarity can make settlement discussions difficult. In the coming years, we expect to see more substantive consideration of damages relating to ESG claims, which will provide valuable insight into the lasting impact these claims will have. Businesses should evaluate for risk pertaining to ESG-related representations made in manufacturing, packaging, marketing and throughout the sales process, as well as their disclosure and reporting practices."

Get exclusive investment industry news and insights, the week\u2019s top headlines, and what you and your clients need to know. For more from Globe Advisor, visit our homepage.\n\nKen O\u2019Kennedy isn\u2019t making predictions about if or when interest rates will drop this year \u2013 or by how much.\n\nInstead, the chief investment officer at Vancouver-based Dixon Mitchell Investment Counsel Inc. prefers to focus on analyzing and understanding businesses he can own long term, regardless of the interest-rate environment.\n\nThe fundamental buy-and-hold strategy has helped his team achieve double-digit returns in recent years.\n\nThe Dixon Mitchell Total Equity Portfolio, with $1.5-billion in assets under management (AUM), has returned 16 per cent over the past year. Its three-year annualized return is 15.7 per cent, while its five-year annualized return is 14.2 per cent. The returns, as of Jan. 31, are gross of fees, which vary by the client and range between 0.8 and 1 per cent.\n\nThe five top holdings in the portfolio are Visa Corp. V-N (6.2 per cent), Dollarama Inc. DOL-T (5.9 per cent), Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG-Q (5.6 per cent), Berkshire-Hathaway Inc. BRK-B-N (5.5 per cent) and Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. ATD-T (5 per cent).\n\nThe Globe and Mail spoke recently with Mr. O\u2019Kennedy, who oversees about $2.5-billion of his firm\u2019s more-than-$5-billion in AUM, about what he\u2019s been buying and selling, and his advice for new investors.\n\nDescribe your investing style.\n\nWe focus on qualitative components of a business based on our own framework. When evaluating a company, we look at five elements: its industry, competitive position, business model, management team and ESG [environmental, social, and governance] performance. We think of ourselves as owners of businesses and try to identify those that can compound at higher rates over time. We have low turnover and highly concentrated portfolios.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the current market environment?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of speculation in the markets, particularly in sectors such as technology and artificial intelligence (AI). While I believe AI represents a platform shift in technology, and there will be opportunities to invest in this theme, it feels like it has been overextended.\n\nDespite some of the current excitement around AI, many tech stocks are supported by fundamentals. Yes, they\u2019re expensive relative to the market, but they\u2019re also growing faster and have much better competitive positions than other companies. The U.S. market looks expensive, but the expected growth and quality are much better than the rest of the world. In other places, the valuations are more reasonable, but they come with lower quality, growth and cyclicality.\n\nWhat have you been buying?\n\nWe added Kinaxis Inc. KXS-T, the Canadian supply-chain management software company, to our Total Equity Portfolio in January and February. We first bought this in our small-cap fund in 2016.\n\nOften, as these businesses execute and grow, they\u2019ll find their way into our Canadian Equity or Total Equity mandates. We generally like software businesses, especially profitable ones. Its product is a huge upgrade for customers, replacing spreadsheets with an always-on view of the business. It\u2019s a leader in this space and growing rapidly.\n\nKinaxis recently launched a quicker-to-implement version of its product, which has helped it open up to the small- and medium-sized business market. It\u2019s a well-run business with high-margin, recurring revenue from its software-as-a-service product. It\u2019s an interesting business that we think can grow significantly.\n\nWe\u2019ve also been buying Ametek Inc. AME-N, a Depew, N.Y.-based company that manufactures electronic appliances and electromechanical devices. Its products are used in the manufacturing of various components in the aerospace, defence, medical and industrial markets. Ametek creates value through acquisitions. It has a strong management team that\u2019s focused on deploying capital effectively.\n\nWhat have you been selling?\n\nOracle Corp. ORCL-N, the software and cloud computing giant, is a company we sold recently. We\u2019ve owned it for more than a decade. We did okay with it. It hasn\u2019t been one of our better performers. While it\u2019s a very good business, we think it\u2019s a bit overvalued. The overall business isn\u2019t growing that fast, and its core database business is under threat from many competitors.\n\nWe also sold Thomson Reuters Corp. TRI-T. The company has undergone an incredible transformation since the sale of its financial and risk business in 2018. However, we see limited upside from here.\n\nName a stock you wish you bought or didn\u2019t sell.\n\nConstellation Software Inc. CSU-T is a stock I wish I had bought. It\u2019s our type of business, and I\u2019ve followed it for a long time. We own it in our Canadian Equity Portfolio, but I regret not owning it in our Total Equity Portfolio. We review it continuously; however, at these levels, near-term returns could be challenging for the stock.\n\nWhat advice do you have for new investors?\n\nKeep your fees low and take advantage of all the registered programs such as the tax-free savings account, registered retirement savings [plan] and, if you\u2019re looking to buy your first home, the new first-home savings account. Also, people who work with financial planners tend to have better outcomes over time, but again, watch the fees.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nFor more from Globe Advisor, visit our homepage."

The intended goal is to reduce the quantities of residual materials to be disposed of once the products reach the end of their life cycle.[4]\n\nAs a result of the Regulation, many businesses chose to impose a so-called \u201cEco Fee\u201d to consumers on the sale of these products to cover the costs of complying with the Regulation.\n\nHow this Eco Fee is displayed in relation to the sales price of the products is the question at the heart of this class action.\n\nProcedural Background\n\nOn May 23rd, 2023, the Class Plaintiff applied for authorization to institute a class action against defendants Dollarama, Loblaw and Shoppers Drug Mart (the latter operating in Quebec under the name Pharmaprix).[5]\n\nThe Class Plaintiff claims that, during the class period, Dollarama did not properly display the entirety of the sale price for the products on which Eco Fees were charged. The Eco Fees ranged from $0.08 to $0.60.\n\nAccording to the Class Plaintiff, Dollarama purposedly fragmented the price displayed by advertising only the basic sales price on its price tag. More specifically, the Class Plaintiff alleged that Dollarama had been:\n\nDisplaying the applicable Eco Fees separately on the shelf label and in a much smaller font size; Adding the applicable Eco Fees to the price of the product only once the customer arrived at the checkout to pay.\n\nThe Class Plaintiff alleged that this was a misleading practice, which was in breach of Sections 223, 223.1 and 224(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, section 1(1)(b) of the Order in Council respecting the Policy on accurate pricing for merchants who use optical scanner technology (the \u201cPolicy on Accurate Pricing\u201d), Articles 6, 7, 1375 or 1458 of the Civil Code of Quebec and Section 54 of the Competition Act.\n\nThe damages allegedly suffered by the Class were premised on Section 1(1)(b) of the Policy on Accurate Pricing which provides that:\n\nIf the product\u2019s exact price is $10 or less, the product must be given to the consumer free of charge; If the price is over $10, a $10 discount must be applied to the purchase of the product.\n\nThe Dollarama Settlement\n\nOn December 10th, 2024, the court approved a settlement against Dollarama, for a total amount of $2,643,718.75. Defendants Loblaw and Shoppers Drug Mart did not participate in the settlement and are still contesting the application for authorization.[6]\n\nUnder the Dollarama settlement, payments to the class members will be done by Interac e-transfers, up to a maximum amount of $10 per class member, depending on the final number of total approved class members. If a high number of approved class members results in e-transfers of less than $3 each, none shall be made, and the funds will be distributed to charities (subject to further approval by the court).\n\nMost significantly, the Dollarama settlement agreement also includes business practice changes that Dollarama has permanently implemented since July 2023, including:\n\nModifying shelf labels for products subject to an Eco Fee, such that the total price displayed includes said fee and further emphasizes said price; and Removing pre-printed Dollarama price tags from these products.\n\nAlthough the Dollarama settlement in this case obviously does not have any precedential value legally, there is no doubt that it sets a precedent in practice on how Eco Fees can be properly dealt with by retailers in Quebec. It also marks a pivotal point, where private enforcement of environmental claims through class actions should be expected to become increasingly common. Class plaintiffs and other environmental activist groups undoubtedly took note.\n\nThe Next Target: Greenwashing Claims\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Dollarama settlement of the Eco Fee class action came only a few months after another environmental related class action was authorized against Dollarama and several other large retailers in relation with alleged greenwashing practices.[7]\n\nThe Class Plaintiff in this second case alleges that the various retailers sued mistakenly advertised their plastic shopping bags as \u201crecyclable,\u201d whereas in fact they were not, thereby contravening the same provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, the Civil Code of Quebec and the Competition Act dealing with misleading advertising.\n\nIn authorizing the class action, the court found that the Class Plaintiff had established on a prima facie basis that the plastic bags are not, in practice, recyclable in Quebec. In doing so, the court explored the question of whether some recyclable materials are largely accepted by recycling facilities, an issue that was also dealt with in the Keurig capsule case,[8] where the Competition Bureau imposed a fine of 3M$ on the basis of a similar reasoning. The court also rejected some of the other defendants\u2019 argument that the bags were folded in such a way before being handed over to the clients that none of them were actually misled by the word \u201crecyclable\u201d, since they could not see it.\n\nThis case comes in the wake of significant amendments to the Competition Act, which introduced specific offences for greenwashing practices, and which have opened the door even more to private enforcement by motivated litigants, including, potentially, environmental activist groups.\n\nFor a deeper understanding of these new amendments, our previous bulletins on the topic provide key insights on the topic: Greenwashing and Canada\u2019s Increased Regulation of Environmental Claims: The Latest Amendments to the Competition Act, Net Zero Plans Deserve Closer Attention Than They Are Getting and Bill C-59\u2019s Expansion of the Competition Act\u2019s Deceptive Marketing Practices: \u201cGreenwashing\u201d and Steering Clear of Environmental Misrepresentation. More recently, the Competition Bureau released draft guidelines on greenwashing enforcement. Please refer to our bulletin discussing those.\n\nWhile lawyers have assisted clients for decades in evaluating and developing technologies, methodologies, products and know-how in support of sustainability and in ensuring compliance with regulatory regimes, what is new is the importance and attention that such claims are now attracting from nearly everyone, but particularly the average consumer.\n\nIn this context, it will be interesting to see how Canadian courts will react to these developments, and whether boundaries will be set that may try to strike an appropriate balance for consumers, between protection of the environment and the cost of doing business for Canadian retailers, which can all too often result in unwelcomed inflation.\n\n[1] Ohayon c.
