            "article_text": "Last spring, visitors to BlackRock\u2019s webpage on sustainable investing saw a striking image of a building covered in bright green moss. Beneath it, the world\u2019s largest asset manager boasted: \u201cWe are committed to supporting the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner.\u201d Not anymore. Today, the webpage has been scrubbed of several references to the firm\u2019s climate commitments. It\u2019s an apparent example of what some are calling \u201cgreenhushing,\u201d in which companies keep quiet about their environmental goals, sometimes for fear of public backlash.\n\nThe trend comes as corporate America sees itself as enmeshed in a tug-of-war over climate change. Liberal activists have sued big businesses for doing too little to combat rising global temperatures, while conservative lawmakers have boycotted firms for even acknowledging that climate change should be part of their business calculations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response, hundreds of businesses have seemingly gone silent. Among 1,200 large private companies that have set climate targets, 1 in 4 do not plan to publicize them, according to a report released last year by South Pole, a climate consultancy and developer of ways that companies can offset their carbon emissions.\n\nFor people who care about climate change, such business practices are crucial. Private corporations control trillions of dollars in assets, and can often move faster than governments in working to avoid the worst climate impacts that scientists have forecast.\n\nGreenhushing is the opposite of a better-known practice called greenwashing, in which companies overstate their sustainability in an attempt to market to environmentally conscious consumers. The rise of hushing reflects the fear that many corporate executives face when weighing whether to speak out on climate change, said Renat Heuberger, the co-founder and CEO of South Pole.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a CEO who has all the right intentions, you might get sued from both sides \u2014 from the left and from the right,\u201d Heuberger said. \u201cAnd that is not good news if you want to convince more CEOs to get active on climate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe South Pole report did not identify companies by name, because the data was collected anonymously. But over the last two years, the beer company Anheuser-Busch InBev has quietly stopped running Facebook advertisements that tout its goals of net-zero emissions by 2040 and 100 percent recycled packaging by 2025, according to a Washington Post review of the company\u2019s ads.\n\nThe decision comes as conservative politicians and personalities boycott Bud Light, which is owned by AB InBev, over its partnership with Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender actress and influencer. Meanwhile, liberal customers have grown angry with the brewer for not sticking up for Mulvaney in the face of criticism.\n\nAna Zenatti, a spokeswoman for AB InBev, said the company has not wavered in its commitment to combating climate change or publicizing those efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSustainability is core to our business,\u201d Zenatti said in an email. \u201cWe are proud of the progress we continue to make on our 2025 Sustainability Goals and our ambition to achieve net zero by 2040 across our value chain, which you can read more about in our 2022 ESG Report. We communicate our sustainability progress and efforts regularly across our channels including AB InBev\u2019s website and company newsroom and social channels, including LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\u201d\n\nAt BlackRock, the changes extend beyond the website. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, a top target of conservative politicians, said last month that he has stopped using the term \u201cESG\u201d altogether because it has become too politicized.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t use the word ESG anymore because it\u2019s been entirely weaponized ... by the far left and weaponized by the far right,\u201d Fink told attendees of the Aspen Ideas Festival. But he said BlackRock would continue to discuss climate and social issues with the companies in which it has stakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA BlackRock spokesman declined to comment on the record for this report.\n\nE-Shhh-G\n\nOn Wall Street, greenhushing comes amid widespread conservative backlash to ESG \u2014 environmental, social and governance \u2014 goals and policies. Republican state treasurers and attorneys general in several states have blacklisted banks that factor climate risks and social concerns into their investment decisions.\n\nMeanwhile, GOP lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee have planned a series of six hearings this month on what they call \u201cwoke investing.\u201d In a report last month, the lawmakers blasted the country\u2019s three largest asset managers \u2014 BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street \u2014 for using their clout \u201cto advance liberal social goals such as ESG and DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion).\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgainst this backdrop, BlackRock and Vanguard have both removed references to climate initiatives from their webpages on sustainable investing over the last year, according to a Post analysis that relied on the Wayback Machine, which archives old versions of websites. In addition to the statement about net-zero emissions, BlackRock has removed language about its membership in Climate Action 100+, an investor-led climate initiative.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when the Climate Action 100+ language was taken down. But last December, Texas state Sen. Bryan Hughes (R) grilled a BlackRock executive about the language during a contentious hearing, accusing the firm of prioritizing climate goals over profits.\n\n\u201cThis is on your website as we sit here today, at this moment,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cBlackRock\u2019s website says: \u2018We have joined Climate Action 100+ to help ensure the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitters take necessary action on climate change.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDalia Blass, who was BlackRock\u2019s head of external affairs at the time, responded: \u201cSir, what I can tell you is that we have joined Climate Action 100+ to make sure we are participating in dialogues that are important to our clients.\u201d\n\nThe response did not satisfy Hughes, who asked: \u201cSo is that statement going to stay on the website?\u201d\n\nAlthough BlackRock\u2019s website no longer includes that specific statement, it does mention that the firm is still a member of Climate Action 100+ and several other industry associations, \u201cincluding those that are related to sustainability and the transition to a low-carbon economy, in order to participate in dialogue on matters that may impact client portfolios.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlackRock is still the most prominent member of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a consortium of big financial firms that have committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. Vanguard quit the initiative as the conservative criticism mounted.\n\nAlso, Vanguard deleted two paragraphs about its \u201cdedication to responsible investing\u201d from its webpage on sustainable investing between April 10 and May 15, according to the Wayback Machine. The second paragraph noted that \u201cas a signatory to the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, we encourage companies to conduct business in a socially conscious way.\u201d\n\nVanguard still mentions its involvement in the U.N.-backed initiative on a separate page on its corporate website. Another page on the corporate site details its approach to climate-related financial risks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Vanguard spokeswoman declined to comment on the record.\n\nWill Hild, executive director of Consumers\u2019 Research, a conservative Washington-based group that fights ESG policies nationwide with millions of dollars in undisclosed donations, said he was elated to learn of the changes at both asset managers.\n\n\u201cIt indicates that there\u2019s increasingly a negative view of these financial services companies pushing environmental policy,\u201d Hild said. Increasingly, he said, companies \u201care shy to brag as much as they previously were about how much they are controlling the American economy.\u201d\n\nOf the word \u201cgreenhushing,\u201d Hild added: \u201cI\u2019m jealous. I wish I\u2019d come up with the term.\u201d\n\nFrom washing to hushing\n\nAcross the Atlantic, European regulators have sought to crack down on greenwashing. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, plans to require companies to substantiate assertions about their sustainability, including claims that their products are \u201cclimate neutral\u201d or \u201ccontaining recycled materials.\u201d\n\nWhile intended to prevent greenwashing, these rules could actually encourage greenhushing among U.S.-headquartered companies that want to sell products in Europe, said Xavier Font, a professor of sustainability marketing at the University of Surrey in England. He predicted that some of these firms would stop touting their sustainability for fear of lawsuits alleging they have violated these directives.\n\n\u201cIf I was a company in the U.S., I would definitely be greenhushing,\u201d Font said.\n\nDaniel Klier, the former head of sustainable finance at the British bank HSBC, agreed."

            "article_text": "The 'anti-woke' crowd found a boogeyman in Anheuser-Busch just as it has with ESG broadly.\n\nLet's talk about beer.\n\nIf you pay much attention to current events, you can guess the one I have in mind: Bud Light. But this isn\u2019t really going to be about a beverage that purports to be \u201ceasy to drink\u201d and \u201ceasy to enjoy\u201d as much as it is about ESG.\n\nI often write about environmental, social and governance issues related to investing. Covering this beat has helped me \u2014 and hopefully some of you \u2014 further understand how ESG factors can affect investment decisions, for better or worse.\n\nIt's a frustrating subject to cover. This isn\u2019t because of trends in the use of ESG factors, nor how sustainable investments have performed.\n\nIt\u2019s because, in a time during which the idea of truth has become subjective, the definition of ESG seems to be up for debate.\n\nFor those who consider such factors in investment decisions, ESG is a source of data that help assess risk and opportunity. But to some, ESG is synonymous with big, shadowy corporations pouring a liberal agenda all over the white-picket-fence-and-apple-pie American way of life. At worst, it\u2019s called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nOf course, ESG has become a victim in the culture wars. It\u2019s a boogeyman that was created in search of a problem, much like the war on \u201cwokeness.\u201d Regarding the latter, I\u2019m unsure of how much opponents are contorting and appropriating a term about recognizing racism and social injustice, or how much they are leaning into it authentically.\n\nFROM FIZZ TO FLAT To summarize the recent Bud Light advertising failure: The beverage maker made a gesture by giving a very limited sponsorship to trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney, presumably with the goal of showing how inclusive it could be, thus extending its appeal to a younger, more progressive drinker base.\n\nThat backfired when some conservatives, including Robert James Ritchie, aka 52-year-old \u201cKid Rock,\u201d who for whatever reason some people pay attention to, aggressively objected. Ritchie very publicly took a semiautomatic rifle to several cases of Bud Light.\n\nSales to the brand\u2019s otherwise loyal base started to drop.\n\nAnheuser-Busch inevitably backpedaled, with CEO Brendan Whitworth stating: \u201cWe never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people. We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer.\u201d\n\nBecause inclusivity, apparently, is divisive.\n\nESG, GOOD OR BAD From an ESG perspective, the irony I see in this is that the forces pushing against any sort of progressive social agenda by a beer maker are the same ones railing against the use of ESG factors in investing, i.e., Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nBecause assessing reputational risk \u2014 as would be useful for Anheuser-Busch investors in this case \u2014 is all about ESG.\n\nWhether you saw financial risk or opportunity in the company\u2019s initial decision to align itself with a trans woman requires consideration of ESG data.\n\nMaybe it could have been an opportunity if Anheuser-Busch stood its ground. The company has marketed to the LGBTQ+ community at least since 1995, and its recent partnership with Mulvaney was not its first ad opportunity featuring a trans person \u2014 in 2016 it had a TV ad featuring comedian Ian Harvie.\n\nAmid the current conservative war on \u201cwokeness,\u201d the company caved, seeming to view a firm stance on trans rights by Bud Light as unnecessarily risky. Now, no one is really happy with Anheuser-Busch. And this episode has been extremely unfair to people in the trans community, who already face immense discrimination and acts of violence against them.\n\nFINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS The company\u2019s stock hasn\u2019t taken a big hit \u2014 and it might not. The incident may soon be forgotten in the dizzying news cycle that will give the anti-woke crowd something else to focus on.\n\nBut fiduciaries investing other people\u2019s money tend to pay attention to headline risk, or reputation. Going further, campaigns that support or reject inclusivity can be evaluated if you consider ESG data. And it\u2019s hard to argue that such data cannot be financially material.\n\nI\u2019m skeptical of many big companies\u2019 intentions, and Anheuser-Busch is not out to make the world a better place \u2014 it wants to sell Bud Light to as many people as it can and make mountains of money.\n\nGenerally, I would say the same about companies that have been vilified for their alleged stances on ESG, including BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard.\n\nSTATE-LEVEL PROBLEMS As numerous states have implemented restrictions on using ESG factors for publicly invested assets, some have confused sustainable and socially responsible investing with ESG. Laws or mandates from state leaders have sought to prevent investing practices that their pension funds don\u2019t use in the first place. Yet, these orders are proclaimed as a major victory, as if they prevent asset managers from eagerly burning piles of cash and advancing whatever social agenda they are accused of having. Some pension professionals in red states have spoken out, projecting that anti-ESG measures could ultimately cost them billions of dollars, and that has led to a handful of bills being watered down."
