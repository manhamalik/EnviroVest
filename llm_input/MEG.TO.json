            "article_text": "An oil worker holds raw sand bitumen near Fort McMurray, on July 9, 2008. (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh) \u00b7 The Canadian Press\n\nMEG Energy (MEG.TO) has temporarily suspended its 2030 and 2050 greenhouse gas emissions targets, blaming recent federal legislation aimed at cracking down on misleading environmental claims.\n\nThe move, announced last week when the oilsands company reported financial results, raises questions about larger industry peers following suit in the coming days.\n\nCalgary-based MEG is among six oilsands companies behind the Pathways Alliance, a group working to advance a massive $16.5 billion carbon capture and storage network in northern Alberta. Last month, Pathways and its members scrubbed information on environmental and climate actions from their websites and social media accounts in response to an anti-greenwashing provision in Bill C-59.\n\nLast Friday, MEG announced a temporary suspension of its 2030 and 2050 greenhouse gas emissions targets until the Competition Bureau of Canada interprets the changes to the Competition Act, which received royal assent on June 20.\n\n\u201cMEG remains fully committed to environmental and climate performance, and the work it is doing to reduce GHG emissions, and will continue to advance its initiatives notwithstanding the cautionary steps it has taken with respect to its environmental disclosure and climate-related targets,\u201d the company stated in a July 26 news release.\n\nThe executives behind Pathways called the disclosure standards in Bill C-59 \u201cso vague as to lack meaning,\u201d and reliant on internationally recognized standards which \u201cmay or may not exist,\u201d in a June 20 joint statement. They say this opens the door to frivolous litigation against oil and gas companies.\n\nIn addition to MEG, Pathways member companies include Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ.TO)(CNQ), Imperial Oil (IMO.TO)(IMO), Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO)(CVE), ConocoPhillips Canada, and Suncor Energy (SU.TO)(SU). All of the member companies have committed to some manner of climate target.\n\n\u201cNo lawyer is going to approve making statements on undefined legislation,\u201d Kevin Krausert, a former oil field services executive who now runs a clean technology venture capital firm and startup accelerator, told Yahoo Finance Canada on Wednesday. \u201cThis legislation has thrown a wet blanket on clean tech innovation across the country.\u201d\n\nCanadian Natural Resources and Cenovus are scheduled to report financial results on Thursday. Imperial is due to release its quarterly financials on Friday. Suncor is scheduled for Aug. 7.\n\n\u201cThe implications are profound for any company making statements,\u201d said Krausert, who declined to comment specifically on potential actions by individual oilsands companies. \u201cThe Competition Bureau needs to offer immediate clarification on what it defines as internationally recognized standards.\u201d"

            "article_text": "Key Insights:\n\nGreenwashing is the practice of conveying false, misleading, or unsupported information about the environmental or climate benefits of an organization\u2019s product, service, activity, or brand. Between 2022 and 2023, the number of alleged greenwashing incidents worldwide increased by 21.1%, with alleged greenwashing cases in Europe rising by 26.1% for the same period. 1 Data out of the EU indicates 40% of green claims have no supporting evidence and 53% of claims are misleading, vague, or unfounded. 2 In Canada, climate-related greenwashing incidents in the banking and financial services sectors increased by 70% in 2023, mainly due to their financing of projects and activities within the fossil fuel and O&G sectors. 3\n\nAs the climate crisis continues to accelerate, governments, corporations, and investors are under increasing pressure to ensure transparency around decarbonization strategies. This article covers the interplay and actions of stakeholder responses to growing concerns of greenwashing risks with Canada\u2019s oil and gas (O&G) sector.\n\nAs part of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Canada committed to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 40%-45% below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. However, Canada saw only a 7.1% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 to 2022.4 While sectors like electricity and heavy industry showed declines, others like O&G and agriculture continued to produce increases in GHG emissions.5\n\nFrom 1990 to 2022, Canada\u2019s O&G sector saw an 83% increase in emissions. In 2022, the sector was the largest GHG emitter in Canada \u2013 accounting for 31% of total emissions for the country.6 This data underscores the importance of targeted efforts across the sector to decarbonize, in line with the country\u2019s climate commitments.\n\nPathways Alliance (Pathways) formed in 2021 as a consortium of Canada\u2019s six largest oil sands producers: Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL), Cenovus Energy, ConocoPhillips Canada, Imperial Oil, MEG Energy, and Suncor Energy. Collectively, these companies operate about 95% of Canada\u2019s oil sands production and are responsible for approximately 2.7 million barrels per day of oil production;7 roughly 63% of Canada\u2019s total.8 Pathways advertised a goal to achieve net zero GHG emissions from oil sands operations by 20509 as part of its efforts to help Canada meet its climate targets. In its sweeping advertising campaign, Pathways stated that it is, \u201cmaking clear strides toward net zero\u201d and that it will, \u201chelp our country achieve a sustainable future.\u201d10\n\nAccording to Morningstar Sustainalytics\u2019 ESG Risk Rating, 44% of Canadian O&G companies have a weak GHG reduction program compared to only 18% and 9% of U.S. and EU based companies respectively (Figure 1). Additionally, 63% of EU O&G companies and 52% of U.S. companies have a very strong program, whereas only 30% Canadian O&G company GHG reduction programs have been rated as very strong.\n\nFigure 1. Comparison of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Programs in the Oil and Gas Sectors in Canada, U.S. and Europe\n\nSource: Morningstar Sustainalytics. For information purposes only.\n\nNote: Data analyzed for 43 Canadian, 63 U.S. and 54 European O&G producers\u2019 GHG reduction programs.\n\nA Civil Response: NGOs and Climate Litigation\n\nA 2023 global climate litigation report revealed that between July 2020 and December 2022, 630 climate change lawsuits were filed across the world \u2013 with Canada having the sixth highest number of climate-related actions filed during this period.11 These actions comprised a range of claims against a variety of corporate issuers, as well as several cases against governments. Furthermore, a recent study determined that 89% of Canadian companies surveyed believe ESG litigation is an emerging risk, but only about 14% of respondents had ESG compliance programs modeling best practices.12\n\nA current application by the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Greenpeace Canada to the Canadian Competition Bureau13 alleges that the claims made by Pathways of, \u201cactively reducing emissions and helping Canada achieve its climate targets,\u201d are false and misleading for the following reasons: They fail to incorporate the lifecycle of the product, They represent that they have and are following a transparent and concrete plan for reducing emissions and/or achieving net zero while they are continuing to expand production, They are based on untenable and not established assumptions about future technologies, and They give the impression that the Pathways Alliance is a climate leader and that their actions will clear pollution when they are not taking actions that do so.\n\n\n\nGreenpeace Canada has asked the Competition Bureau to have Pathways remove all the representations about reducing emissions, achieving net zero, cleaning air, and combatting climate change as well as issue a public retraction of these statements and pay a fine that is the greater of CAD 10 million (USD 7.3 million) or 3% of worldwide gross revenues to organizations for the rehabilitation and cleanup of oil sands production. The complaint was submitted in March of 2023 and the Competition Bureau has yet to make a determination.\n\nGovernment Response: Introduction of Anti-Greenwashing Rules\n\nIn June 2024, amendments were made to Canada\u2019s Competition Act as part of Bill C-59.14 The Competition Act makes it illegal for companies to market or promote goods or services based on unfounded or misleading claims. Companies making misrepresentations to the public through deceptive marketing practices are subject to orders and administrative penalties.\n\nCanada's latest competition law amendments create new rules for businesses' environment-related messages or representations and aim to combat greenwashing by requiring companies to provide evidence to back up their environmental claims. New conditions specific to environmental claims require that representation of a product\u2019s environmental benefits must be based on an adequate and proper test. They also require that representation of the environmental benefits of a business or business activity be based on adequate and proper substantiation, in line with internationally recognized methodology. These new amendments apply to any business or individual that is marketing products, services, or any business interests.\n\n\n\nExamples of greenwashing risk exposure aligned with the amendments include product claims of environmental benefit, such as low-carbon fuel labelled with sustainability information, and social claims such as those aligned with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Environmental claims at the business level must also be substantiated by an internationally recognized methodology, which includes net zero and carbon-neutral claims. However, the current Competition Act legislation doesn\u2019t define what constitutes an internationally recognized methodology for backing up claims about a business or business activity. Additional guidance from the Competition Bureau is required to provide clarity on what is considered acceptable, and the bureau is speeding the development of this guidance, while opening a feedback forum for related comments or suggestions.\n\n\n\nImmediately following the passing of Bill C-59, Pathways replaced its website, social media, and other public communications content with a notice.15 The notice stated that the consortium remained committed to its work and reducing environmental impacts from oil sands production, but that the changes to the Competition Act create significant uncertainty for Canadian companies that want to communicate publicly about the work they are doing to improve their environmental performance.16 Five of the six Pathways consortium companies have also removed all or most ESG and climate-related content from their websites (with U.S.-based ConocoPhillips being the one company who did not).\n\n\n\nAn Investor Response: Shedding Light With ESG Research, Data and Stewardship\n\nAll six Pathways consortium companies are engaged with the Sustainalytics Material Risk Engagement Stewardship program, which is an engagement overlay to the Sustainalytics\u2019 ESG Risk Ratings. Investors can use Sustainalytics\u2019 risk research and stewardship services to uncover ESG data and information about Pathways consortium companies that is no longer available on their websites."

            "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: An Israeli navy vessel patrols near an oil platform in the Leviathan gas field off the Israeli coast on Sept. 20.Ariel Schalit/The Associated Press\n\nOil prices jumped 2.6 per cent on Tuesday as global concerns grew that military conflict in the Middle East could escalate and threaten production facilities in Iran and other major oil producers in the region.\n\nIran, the world\u2019s ninth-largest oil producer, fired hundreds of missiles at Israeli cities in retaliation for Israel\u2019s deadly bombings in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel\u2019s military operations have included killing senior leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah and now involve ground attacks in southern Lebanon.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden has pledged help for Israel in its defence against Iranian missile attacks.\n\nWorld benchmark Brent crude settled up US$1.86 at US$73.56 a barrel on Tuesday, its highest level since Sept. 24 but still well off the year\u2019s highs. West Texas Intermediate finished the session at US$69.83 a barrel, up US$1.66. Earlier in the day, prices were up as much as 5.5 per cent.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of oil production or export facilities under attack, or flows being disrupted, but Daniel Ghali, director of commodities strategy with TD Securities, said the expanding hostilities throughout the region could add a new risk premium to the market.\n\nLate on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu increased those odds, vowing to retaliate against Iran. Mr. Netanyahu said the missile attack was a failure and that Iran would soon learn a painful lesson, as its enemies in Gaza, Lebanon and other places have learned.\n\n\u201cThis is a very significant escalation in the conflict in the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Ghali said. \u201cAny time Iran and Israel are firing directly at each other, it raises the risk that energy infrastructure might be impacted, and that would be very significant for oil prices.\u201d\n\nDespite Tuesday\u2019s sharp gain in oil prices, crude remains well under this year\u2019s highs above US$91 a barrel. The market has been weak in recent months owing to lower-than-expected demand, notably in China, as well as speculation that Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest producer, and its OPEC allies could open their taps in a bid for more market share.\n\nIran backs Hamas, Hezbollah and Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who are also hostile to Israel. It also exports about 1.7 million barrels a day. Mr. Ghali said a wider regional conflict in the Middle East could put energy infrastructure at risk in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which holds the most spare capacity of any country.\n\nJackie Forrest, executive director of the ARC Energy Research Institute in Calgary, said oil markets have so far shrugged off the impact of the Middle East conflict as it has dragged on over the past year because it has not resulted in the disruption of any supplies.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a risk, and there\u2019s great potential for the war to go beyond where it is today and Iran to get involved, and it really could have impacts on the oil market,\u201d Ms. Forrest said. \u201cBut because this whole year has been characterized by risks that never materialized in outages, you\u2019re not really seeing people put much high probability on that event.\u201d\n\nStill, the industry is taking precautions. On Tuesday, Chevron Corp. CVX-N said it had shut down two natural gas platforms off the Israeli coast. The platforms, Tamar and Leviathan, supply the Israeli market as well as those in Egypt and Jordan, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe rise in oil prices prompted sizable gains in the shares of many Canadian oil producers. The S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index rose 3.4 per cent on the day to its highest since early September.\n\nAmong the sector\u2019s big names, Suncor Energy Inc. SU-T rose 4 per cent, Cenovus Energy Inc. CVE-T gained 2.4 per cent, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. CNQ-T jumped 4.5 per cent and MEG Energy Corp. MEG-T climbed 3.8 per cent.\n\nThe profitability of oil-weighted producers has weakened as crude prices fell about US$10 a barrel in the past year, so the upward movement is beneficial to them, said Jonah Resnick, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie. However, the gains will not likely affect their capital spending plans for the remainder of the year, he said.\n\nWith a report from Reuters"

            "article_text": "A group of Canada\u2019s leading oil sands companies announced the launch today of the Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero initiative, aiming to significantly improve the sustainability profile of the controversial sector.\n\nWorking collectively with the federal and Alberta governments, the companies, including Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus Energy, Imperial, MEG Energy and Suncor Energy, aim to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from oil sands operations by 2050.\n\nTim McKay, Canadian Natural President, said:\n\n\u201cCanada has an opportunity to lead on climate change by delivering meaningful emissions reductions as well as balancing sustainable economic development. Canadian ingenuity has enabled oil sands development and with continued innovation, positions Canada to be the ESG-leading barrel to meet global energy demand. We are committed to working together with industry partners and governments to help meet Canada\u2019s climate objectives while providing sustainable long-term economic and social benefits for Canadians from the oil sands.\u201d\n\nAs investors, companies, consumers and regulators become increasingly aware of the climate effects of energy production, oil sands producers are coming under growing pressure to address their environmental impact. Oil sands are among the most carbon-intensive sources of crude oil production, and several investors and financiers have recently announced policies to restrict activities and divest from investment in this area. The sector also represents a significant contributor to the Canadian and Alberta economies, however, accounting for an estimated more than $3 trillion in Canadian GDP over the next 30 years, according to the companies.\n\nThe initiative aims to achieve its net zero goal through several pathways. These include the development of a core Alberta infrastructure corridor linking multiple oil sands projects to a carbon sequestration hub, deployment of existing and emerging GHG reduction technologies at oil sands operations along the corridor, including CCUS technology, clean hydrogen, process improvements, energy efficiency, fuel switching and electrification, and the application of potential emerging emissions-reducing technologies including direct air capture, next-generation recovery technologies and small modular nuclear reactors.\n\nMark Little, Suncor President and Chief Executive Officer, said:\n\n\u201cCollaboration among companies, innovators and governments is critical to achieving ambitious goals. That\u2019s how we built a budding oil sands resource into one of the world\u2019s most reliable and ESG-leading oil basins in the world. Canada \u2013 as one of the few jurisdictions with industrial-scale commercial CCUS projects in operation \u2014 coupled with Alberta\u2019s abundant natural gas resources, geology and relevant technological expertise \u2013 is well positioned to lead in this area.\u201d\n\nThe group stressed the need for supportive government policies, fiscal programs and regulations on the road to meeting its climate objectives, including dependable access to carbon sequestration rights, emissions reduction credits and ongoing investment tax credits.\n\nSonya Savage, Alberta\u2019s Minister of Energy, said:"

The fund also follows blacklisting standards set out by the Paris Agreement, standards expanded in 2022 to include companies without climate transition plans and companies involved in large scale coal operations and oil sands extraction.\n\nIncluding these two additions, AP7 has blacklisted 53 fossil-fuel companies based on these standards, with another 10 excluded based on other criteria. In total, the fund has blacklisted 110 companies, including companies involved in the development and production of nuclear weapons and companies that violate the UN Global Compact\u2019s 10 principles.\n\nThe fund removed two companies, Hitachi Zosen Corp. and SGL Carbon S.E., from the blacklist \u201cbased on the lack of verified information about ongoing violations by the companies.\u201d\n\nIn June, the fund added Saudi Aramco to the blacklist, as well as six other oil producers due to alleged violations of the Paris Agreement. In December 2023, AP7 added two Chinese coal producers to the blacklist, while removing AECOM, Tata Power Co. and Hanwha Corp. from the list.\n\nIn a press release, AP7 stated that it uses blacklisting as an engagement tool, along with other tools such as company dialogues and voting at company general meetings.\n\nIn total, AP7 manages 1.1 trillion Swedish kroner ($100 billion) in assets. The fund counts more than 5 million Swedes\u2014roughly half the population of Sweden\u2014as members and beneficiaries.

            "article_text": "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE\n\nWith this Earth Day supplement, the Inquirer begins a lineup of themed content and activities as a founding member of the Asia Sustainability Impact Consortium (Asic), whose two other pillars are The Star Group of Malaysia and Kompas Gramedia of Indonesia.\n\nConsidered the first cross-border media alliance of its kind, the Asic can reach an audience of 123 million across the region as it promotes environmental advocacies, most especially in the corporate and industrial sectors\u2014in the world of work.\n\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\nThe paper hopes to do its part through the Inquirer ESG Edge initiative. This six-page special project serves as its soft launch, so to speak, fittingly timed with Earth Day and published exactly a month after the company signed up 11 local partners\u2014green groups, education foundations, think tanks and business associations\u2014for the advocacy.\n\nThe Inquirer ESG Edge logo also makes its debut here, and will henceforth mark news and feature articles related to the initiative in future issues, as well as events or campaigns that will take it beyond the printed page and into communities, schools, etc.\n\nESG stands for environment, social and governance. While there may be no handy standard or catch-all definition of ESG, it is the catchphrase for a movement that first came to prominence in the mid-2000s.\n\nIt is generally a set of aspects, a measure\u2014a checklist, if you will\u2014by which a company is evaluated by regulators and potential investors based on its sensitivity to the impact it makes on the environment and society in general.\n\nInvestopedia.com, for example, expounds on the concept of \u201cESG investing,\u201d explaining it as follows:\n\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\n\u201cESG investing refers to how companies score on (a set of) responsibility metrics and standards for potential investments. Environmental criteria gauge how a company safeguards the environment. Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers and communities. Governance measures a company\u2019s leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights.\u2019\u2019\n\nKey questions may be asked under the \u2018\u2019environment\u2019\u2019 metrics: What are the company polices on energy use, waste and pollution, natural resource conservation or even treatment of animals? Is it led by accountable managers who are mindful of these concerns and truthful in reporting the company\u2019s compliance with government regulations?\n\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\n\u201cDoes the company donate a percentage of profits to the local community or encourage employees to volunteer? Do workplace conditions reflect a high regard for employees\u2019 health and safety?\u2019\u2019 read a sample question provided by Investopedia under the \u201csocial\u201d yardstick.\n\nAs to quality of \u201cgovernance,\u2019\u2019 it added, \u201cESG investors may require assurances that companies avoid conflicts of interest in their choice of board members and senior executives, don\u2019t use political contributions to obtain preferential treatment or engage in illegal conduct.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn the Philippines, the Securities and Exchange Commission is the primary body pushing ESG in the business community. We thus open this special supplement with a look at how it is being done.\n\nThese days, investors are not just in it for the return on their investments, or making sure the money they put into companies and projects are worth it.\n\nGlobally, regulators are seeing to it that publicly listed companies are making good on their promises to include sustainability in their businesses, as this is now a criteria considered by investors prior to shelling out money.\n\nKPMG, a global organization offering auditing services and insights in 143 countries, found in its 2022 Survey of Sustainability Reporting that investors are taking nonfinancial data, such as sustainability reports, \u201cjust as seriously as financial data.\u201d\n\nSuch pressure has pushed the creation of reporting standards across the globe, among them those of the Global Reporting Initiative, International Integrated Reporting Council, and the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued in 2019 its sustainability reporting guidelines for publicly listed companies, following in the footsteps of its international counterparts.\n\nIn issuing the guidelines, the local corporate watchdog noted that sustainability reporting, or the practice of publicizing a company\u2019s economic, environmental and social impacts, may provide companies a competitive edge while attracting more investors and improving reputation.\n\nBut the SEC stipulated that reports must not contain mere numbers related to sustainability.\n\n7 reporting principles\n\nAs environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting involves a wide range of topics, the SEC listed seven reporting principles.\n\nThese include materiality (reporting only on relevant topics); stakeholder inclusiveness (taking into account the needs and interests of key stakeholders); balance (reflecting the positive and negative aspects of the company\u2019s performance); completeness (the extent of information needed); reliability (reporting on methodology to assess the quality of information); accuracy (properly citing information sources); and consistency and comparability (ensuring that the report allows for analysis over a period of time).\n\nEach component of ESG represents a vital puzzle piece in the entire image considered by investors.\n\nMichael Ricafort, chief economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., tells the Inquirer that compliance with ESG standards signals good business. Corporations need to ensure that their policies are friendly to the environment through sustainable practices, while also promoting a better society by respecting and upholding human rights.\n\nAt the same time, governance policies need to be consistent with global best practices and \u201cuphold the highest level of ethical standards and practices in conducting business and in dealing with society,\u201d says Ricafort.\n\nFor example, the SEC reporting template includes questions on energy efficiency initiatives, water consumption, air pollution, and solid waste management, among others, to measure climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nPenalties for noncompliance\n\nA closer look at the guidelines likewise show that ESG reporting is not limited to sustainability.\n\nThere are indicators that look at the governance piece of the puzzle, as the commission also provided tables detailing \u201cincidents of corruption\u201d among officers and directors of the companies.\n\nUnder the SEC guidelines, companies listed on the local bourse are required to submit their sustainability reports along with their annual reports.\n\nCompanies that fail to comply will have their annual reports classified incomplete, and will be met with penalties ranging from P30,000 to P60,000, as shown in the SEC\u2019s Memorandum Circular No. 6, Series of 2005.\n\nWhen the reporting guidelines were published in 2019, the regulator found that only 22 percent of publicly listed companies have published a report on sustainability impacts and performances.\n\nBut three years later, KPMG reported that the Philippines, one of its newest partner countries, now has among the highest rates of compliance in the Asia-Pacific region at 87 percent.\n\n\u201cThese sustainability reporting requirements are just one of the growing regulations that are driving sustainable development in the country,\u201d KPMG said in its 2022 report.\n\n\u201cThis is resulting in better disclosures and initiatives among the [top 100 companies] of the Philippines, with many now incorporating ESG considerations in their corporate strategies and investments,\u201d it added.\n\nVietnam had the same rate, while Thailand had 86 percent. Japan had the best performance, as all of its top companies complied with sustainability reporting requirements, according to KPMG.\n\nKey motivations\n\nApart from investor attractiveness and stakeholder engagement, the SEC said sustainability reporting also resulted in improved management systems, a motivated workforce, and effective management of sustainability risks and opportunities.\n\nThese may have been the key motivations of corporations in becoming more transparent about their businesses.\n\nA look at the websites of the Philippines\u2019 largest and oldest conglomerates show that they have special pages detailing their sustainability initiatives.\n\nBut while these improvements are notable, CFA Institute warns that the scope of global ESG reporting standards pose the risk of \u201cgreenwashing,\u201d or intentionally misleading investors and stakeholders, giving them an impression that their investments are going to the right projects.\n\n\u201cOver time, greenwashing may lead to an erosion of trust in the investment management industry,\u201d CFA, a global association of investment professionals, said in its 2021 Global ESG Disclosure Standards for Investment Products.\n\nThe most obvious solution to greenwashing, according to nonprofit organization ClientEarth and the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC), is telling the truth.\n\n\u201cJust be transparent about what you\u2019re doing, how decisions are being made, and on what basis you are making these [sustainability] statements,\u201d Anjali Viswamohanan, director of policy at AIGCC, said in a media forum in Singapore last year.\n\nAIGCC and ClientEarth in 2023 published their Asia greenwashing report, where they found that there was a heightened scrutiny of greenwashing across the globe, particularly in Asia.Greenwashing watchdogs\n\nClientEarth legal counsel Sean Tsung said journalists also served as greenwashing watchdogs, as they have access to company reports and can hold corporate leaders accountable.\n\n\u201cWe talked about matching [companies\u2019] statements with past conduct \u2026 and making sure that it all aligns. If there\u2019s suspicion that it doesn\u2019t align, then there is room for inquiry to be made,\u201d he said.\n\nIn all, the SEC aims for its guidelines to encourage corporations to be more truthful about how they respond to sustainability challenges, in addition to financial challenges, as both determine their \u201clong-term viability and competitiveness.\u201d\u201d\n\nThe guidelines recognize that sustainability reporting is a journey and that the [publicly listed companies] would be at different levels in this journey,\u201d the commission said.\n\nYour subscription could not be saved.

            "article_text": "New provisions in the Competition Act clamp down on false environmental claims to restore consumer, investor trust\n\nWhen making environmental claims about products and practices in Canada, companies can no longer just talk the talk. They must also walk the walk to back up what they\u2019re saying.\n\nNew greenwashing provisions that were among the amendments to the Competition Act that became law last month with the passage of Bill C-59 prohibit deceptive environmental claims, requiring them to be based on \"adequate and proper tests\" or \"internationally recognized methodologies.\"\n\nThe legislation also introduces private rights of action, allowing private parties to bring greenwashing claims before the Competition Tribunal, and broadens the criteria for granting leave. Currently, only the Competition Bureau can bring a deceptive marketing application.\n\n\u201cThis is a win for Canadians and the economy,\u201d says Catherine McKenna, former minister of environment and climate change with the Trudeau government and chair of the UN's High-Level Expert Group on the Net-Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities.\n\n\u201cGreenwashing is a massive issue, and when you think of a competition law, it's supposed to protect consumers, and it's supposed to ensure that the market works properly. Greenwashing, where people say things that are not true, has a very negative impact on consumers who are trying to figure out what products and services are actually good for the environment.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKenna, a former competition lawyer, it also impedes investors\u2019 need for proper information.\n\nA Deloitte survey last year found that 57 per cent of Canadian consumers don\u2019t believe most green claims brands make, and are confused and frustrated by how widespread they are. As a result, 46 per cent weren\u2019t willing to pay more for sustainable products because they had a hard time determining which were genuinely sustainable.\n\nJulien Beaulieu, a competition lawyer who authored the report \u201cClimate-washing: How to Turn the Tide,\u201d says because people haven\u2019t had any way to verify companies\u2019 claims, they\u2019re vulnerable, which makes them skeptical, given the potential for deception. As a result, environmental claims have become cheap talk.\n\nUltimately, that lack of trust hurts the brands investing in greener, more sustainable products and practices because they can\u2019t differentiate themselves from the greenwashers.\n\n\u201cThis legislation will increase the value of environmental information and help shift from a world where it\u2019s cheap talk to a world where it\u2019s something people can examine and take into consideration when they make decisions,\u201d Beaulieu says, whether it\u2019s about where to bank or whether to work for a particular company.\n\nGreenwashing penalties are severe, with administrative monetary penalties on a corporation of up to the greater of $10 million ($15 million for subsequent orders) or three times the benefit gained from the misrepresentation. If that can\u2019t be determined, corporations are looking at three percent of annual worldwide gross revenues.\n\nIn the days before the legislation received royal assent, Pathways Alliance, a group of fossil fuel companies in Alberta\u2019s oil patch, pulled down all content on its website and social media feeds and replaced it with this notice.\n\nOther extractive companies followed suit.\n\nIn a joint news release, Alliance members Canadian Natural Resources, Imperial Oil Ltd., MEG Energy, Cenovus Energy, ConocoPhillips Canada, and Suncor Energy said, \u201cOur ability to remain transparent has been significantly compromised as a result of Bill C-59.\u201d\n\n\u201cCreating a public disclosure standard that is so vague as to lack meaning and that relies on undefined \"internationally recognized methodology\" opens the door for frivolous litigation, particularly by private entities who will now be empowered to directly enforce this new provision of the Competition Act,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThis represents a serious threat to freedom of communication.\u201d\n\nLisa Baiton, president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said that the threat of very significant penalties will curtail the ability of many Canadians to participate in debates around climate and environmental policy and prevent businesses from communicating their environmental efforts.\n\n\u201cThe effect of this legislation is to silence the energy industry and those that support it in an effort to clear the field of debate and to promote the voices of those most opposed to Canada\u2019s energy industry,\u201d she wrote in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs a result, CAPP has chosen to reduce the amount of information it makes available on its website and other digital platforms until the Competition Bureau has released further guidance on how these amendments will be implemented.\u201d\n\nBaiton says the amendments were put forward without consultation, clarity on guidelines, or the standards that must be met to achieve compliance, putting businesses across Canada \u201cat significant risk.\u201d\n\n\"There\u2019s certainly uncertainty that\u2019s been introduced,\u201d says Conor Chell, an ESG lawyer with KPMG in Calgary.\n\nThe legislation requires that representations of a product\u2019s benefits for protecting or restoring the environment are supported by adequate and proper tests, while representations of a business or business activity for protecting or restoring the environment or mitigating the causes or effects of climate change \u2014 such as net zero and carbon neutral claims \u2014 must be based on an internationally recognized methodology.\n\nChell says while adequate and proper tests are defined relative to other pieces of legislation in case law, the Act doesn\u2019t provide a definition or guidance around internationally recognized methodologies.\n\nHowever, he thinks the government wanted a flexible approach rather than an exhaustive or prescriptive one to avoid industry and geographic-specific standards and methodologies.\n\nBeaulieu says plenty of terms are undefined in the Act, but \u201cit's a law of general application, so it makes sense that it's drafted in general terms.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s up to the courts to interpret terms, but the government can adopt regulations if it wants to be specific.\n\nIn light of the \u201clarge number of requests for guidance\u201d on interpreting the greenwashing provisions, the Competition Bureau has launched public consultations and plans to develop guidance on an accelerated basis.\n\nAs for industry concerns about the provisions feeding \u201cfrivolous litigation,\u201d Beaulieu points out that only the Competition Bureau can file a lawsuit for the next year. Once the private right of action is live, a party must obtain leave from the Competition Tribunal before a claim can proceed.\n\n\u201cThe Bureau is a careful agency. It\u2019s quite prudent and knows the effect that its enforcement actions can have. It won't be interested in chilling green claims further.\u201d\n\nThat said, Chell finds it interesting that the enforcement and greenwashing provisions were finalized before the mandatory legal reporting requirements for ESG and sustainability.\n\n\u201cIt does create a substantial amount of legal risk for any organization with public ESG or sustainability disclosures,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWhat this means for most companies is an actual reset of not only their sustainability or ESG disclosure, but also their strategies, programs, policies, processes and controls. Everything that they do and the way in which they approach sustainability now needs to be looked at through a legal lens.\u201d\n\nIn a joint statement, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, Energy and Minerals Minister Brian Jean and Environment and Protected Areas Minister Rebecca Schulz called the legislation \u201cdraconian\u201d and \u201cabsurd authoritarian censorship\u201d aimed at preventing \u201cprivate entities from sharing truthful and evidence-based information that happens to oppose the extreme and untruthful oil and gas narrative of the federal NDP and Liberals,\u201d and \u201ceco-extremists like Minister Stephen Guilbeault.\u201d\n\nMcKenna points out that every party supported the legislation and says it\u2019s not a freedom of speech issue, it\u2019s about truth in advertising.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t an attack on Alberta. It's not an attack on oil and gas. This applies to everyone. It's just saying that we need people to be truthful, so if you're going to say something, back it up with evidence. Canada is not inventing the wheel here,\u201d she says, noting all G7 countries require truth in advertising.\n\nIn that vein, McKenna says it\u2019s \u201cvery telling\u201d that so much industry content was pulled offline ahead of Bill C-59\u2019s passage.\n\n\u201cClearly, their lawyers, I assume, have advised them that they\u2019re very at risk because they are not being truthful in their advertising, and they cannot back up their claims.\u201d\n\nThe industry has said it wants to be part of the solution, and many companies have committed to net zero, says McKenna, whose UN work with the High-Level Expert Group set out standards for net-zero emissions pledges. Among them is a requirement for actual emission reductions aligned with scientific targets, refraining from investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure and ending lobbying efforts against climate action.\n\nShe says Canada\u2019s oil and gas industry is doing none of this. Oilsands emissions are rising and companies aren\u2019t investing in clean solutions at scale. Recent reports have found that carbon capture won\u2019t deliver the reductions the industry claims it will.\n\n\u201cYet, everywhere one looks, they\u2019re advertising, saying they\u2019re part of the solution\u2026 when we\u2019re in a fossil fuel climate crisis.\u201d"

Beyond aligning on core metrics, bringing the team leads together \u201chas been really good [for] the internal relationship piece and \u2018mutual learning,'\u201d said Fallender. \u201cOur ESG team knows more [about] the metrics and the need for support, whereas our operations teams brought data process expertise, and the accounting team [brought important] perspective about internal audits.\u201d\n\nThe teams had collaborated before, but preparing for the regulations and responding to increasing investor and customer data needs has taken collaboration to a higher level.\n\nInvest in data management and IT systems\n\nPrologis spends a lot of time on data, transparency and data management systems because it drives much of what the company does, said Fallender. The company created a \u201cdata lake,\u201d or central data repository that can \u201cpull or push data\u201d from various internal and external sources, ensuring that they are interoperable.\n\nInvolving the IT team in decision-making has been important, Fallender said, because it can be difficult to sort through the many software options for managing ESG data. Fallender also found it helpful to discuss potential future needs for data management because she\u2019s learned that investing in a tool to meet your immediate needs may leave you soon searching for a new tool when your goals change.\n\nGet creative when addressing Scope 3 data gaps\n\nPrologis is keen to automate data collection, especially for Scope 3 emissions, which are its biggest data gap. The company set a net-zero goal for operations by 2030 and its value chain by 2040, and with Scope 3 emissions accounting for 99 percent of the company\u2019s greenhouse gas footprint, Prologis has a lot of work to do.\n\nCustomer energy use in the 1.2 billion square feet of warehouses, distribution centers and other logistics facilities that Prologis owns, operates and develops comprises 75 percent of its Scope 3 emissions. The remainder is embodied carbon in construction building materials. Accessing customer energy data is tough, especially because Prologis, headquartered in San Francisco, operates in 19 countries with different management and lease structures.\n\nTo more easily access that data, and close its Scope 3 gap, Prologis is working toward \u201cgreen lease\u201d language and changing utility metering practices. Green leases contain language about sharing data and other provisions designed to align tenant and landlord interests around energy efficiency and water conservation. \u201cIt\u2019s a multiyear process to continue to automate that data to get away from some of the manual data collection tasks, such as asking customers to share it,\u201d said Fallender.\n\nUse your core business goals to drive your approach\n\nWithout strong goals to guide data collection and management, the task can seem overwhelming. At Prologis, \u201cwe\u2019ve come at this from [the perspective of], how does all of this work help us create value for the customers?\u201d Fallender said. \u201cWe don\u2019t make these decisions in a bubble.\u201d Prologis relies on customer advisory boards to ensure it gets their feedback.\n\nFor example, when Prologis set its net-zero goal, Fallender and others helped people across the organization understand the twin goals of the commitment \u2014 both reducing Prologis\u2019 carbon footprint and helping customers on their decarbonization journey. Prologis customers were asking for solar panels and EV charging stations, and it wasn\u2019t always possible to install those, Fallender said. To help implement the company\u2019s net-zero goal, Prologis changed its construction guidelines to include solar energy and charging station installation capabilities in all new projects.\n\nAs Prologis builds its data management systems, its net-zero goal and customer-centered approach are driving its approach. That\u2019s why Fallender doesn\u2019t mind the new regulations\u2019 \u201cmessiness,\u201d or the \u201chockey stick rate of change in increased attention and criticism,\u201d as she puts it. \u201cI think all of that means that we are changing the conversation in a meaningful way.\u201d"
