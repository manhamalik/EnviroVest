            "article_text": "4.80% Notes, Series CAO due December 15, 2028\n\n4.95% Notes, Series CAP due February 18, 2031\n\n5.10% Sustainability-Linked Notes, Series CAN due February 15, 2034\n\nVANCOUVER, BC, Feb. 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - TELUS announced today it has priced $1.8 billion of senior unsecured notes in three series, the first with a 4-year and 10-month maturity, the second with a 7-year maturity and the third with a 10-year maturity. The notes are offered through a syndicate of agents led by CIBC World Markets Inc, RBC Dominion Securities Inc. and Scotia Capital Inc. Closing of the offering is expected to occur on or about February 15, 2024.\n\nThe 4.80% notes, Series CAO, were priced at $99.895 per $100 principal amount for an effective yield of 4.826% per annum until maturity, and will mature on December 15, 2028.\n\nThe 4.95% notes, Series CAP, were priced at $99.707 per $100 principal amount for an effective yield of 5.000% per annum until maturity, and will mature on February 18, 2031.\n\nThe 5.10% Sustainability-Linked notes, Series CAN (the \"Series CAN Notes\"), were priced at $99.644 per $100 principal amount for an effective yield of 5.146% per annum until maturity, subject to a possible interest rate step-up, and will mature on February 15, 2034.\n\nThe net proceeds of this offering will be used for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, including all or a portion of the repayment upon maturity of TELUS' 3.35% Series CK Notes due April 2024, as well as the repayment of a portion of commercial paper (incurred for general working capital purposes) and/or the repayment of a portion of TELUS' $1.1 billion unsecured Credit Facility with a term expiring July 2024, and for other general corporate purposes.\n\nThe Series CAN notes are \"Sustainability-Linked Bonds\" issued pursuant to TELUS' Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework announced on June 14, 2021, as it may be amended, restated and/or replaced from time to time (the \"Framework\") and will be TELUS' sixth bond offering under the Framework. As part of the Framework, TELUS has committed to reducing its absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions by 46% from 2019 levels by 2030. Should TELUS fail to achieve this target (the \"Sustainability Performance Target\") by December 31, 2030, the interest payable on the Series CAN Notes will increase by 0.50% per annum, as will be further detailed in the prospectus supplement that TELUS will be filing to its short form base shelf prospectus dated August 8, 2022 with securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces of Canada. The interest payable on the Series CAN Notes may also increase in certain circumstances if TELUS fails to meet additional sustainability and/or environmental, social or governance (\"ESG\") targets as provided for in a future \"Sustainability-Linked Bond\" (a \"Future SLB\") issued by TELUS pursuant to the Framework. The interest rate on the Series CAN Notes, however, can in no event exceed the initial rate of 5.10% by more than 1.00% per annum in the aggregate, whether as a result of the failure to achieve the Sustainability Performance Target and/or any targets under one or more Future SLBs.\n\nThe Series CAN Note offering supports TELUS' commitment to environmental sustainability by linking financing to the achievement of ambitious ESG targets. The target set out in the Framework was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (\"SBTi\"), further demonstrating TELUS' global sustainability leadership and support of the world's fight against climate change. The Sustainability Performance Target is consistent with reductions required to limit warming to below 1.5\u00b0C, which at the time of publication of the Framework, was considered the most ambitious designation available through the SBTi process.\n\nTELUS will report annually on its performance against the Sustainability Performance Target and will also obtain an annual independent and external verification of its performance against the Sustainability Performance Target in the form of a limited assurance report. TELUS' performance as well as the limited assurance report will be included in its annual Sustainability and ESG Report, or other similar report(s) as the case may be, and will be available on TELUS' website.\n\nSustainalytics, a leading independent ESG research, ratings and analytics firm, issued a Second Party Opinion in June 2021 (as subsequently extended) confirming that the Framework aligns with the International Capital Market Association's Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles, 2020.\n\nThis media release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities in any jurisdiction. The securities being offered have not been approved or disapproved by any Canadian securities regulatory authority, nor has any authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of the short form base shelf prospectus or the prospectus supplement. The notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and no notes of any series are being offered in the United States or to or for the account or benefit of any U.S. person.\n\nThe notes of each series are being offered pursuant to a prospectus supplement to the short form base shelf prospectus of TELUS dated August 8, 2022. The short form base shelf prospectus and prospectus supplement contain important detailed information about each series of notes. Copies of the short form base shelf prospectus and the prospectus supplement relating to the offering of each series of notes when filed with securities regulatory authorities in Canada may be obtained from the Chief Legal and Governance Officer of TELUS at 510 W. Georgia St., 23rd Floor, Vancouver, British Columbia V6B 0M3 (telephone 604-695-6420).

Investors should read the short form base shelf prospectus and prospectus supplement before making an investment decision.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis news release contains statements about future events pertaining to the offering, including the anticipated closing date of the offering, the intended use of the net proceeds of the offering, the Framework, including TELUS' commitment to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 46% from 2019 levels by 2030, the increase in the interest rate per annum of the Series CAN Notes if TELUS fails to reach the Sustainability Performance Target by the required date, the increase in the interest rate per annum of the Series CAN Notes if TELUS fails to reach additional ESG targets as provided for in a Future SLB(s), and TELUS' commitments to report annually on its performance against its Sustainability Performance Target, to obtain an annual independent and external verification of its performance against the Sustainability Performance Target in the form of a limited assurance report and to include such performance and such limited assurance report in TELUS' annual Sustainability and ESG Report or other similar reports and make them available on TELUS' website.

The costly impacts of climate change and, more than anything, the declining costs of low-carbon technologies continue to drive investment in solutions.\n\nCorporate Knights\u2019 Global 100 ranking of the world\u2019s most sustainable firms, now in its 21st year, shows that the top firms continue to increase their investment in the green transition. Even with higher interest rates in recent years, leading corporations have expanded their sustainable investments, which has resulted in a growing share of income being derived from sustainable revenue sources.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding that growth in sustainable revenues is outpacing all other revenues,\u201d says Toby Heaps, co-founder and CEO of Corporate Knights. \u201cOver the last five years for major global public companies, sustainable revenues are growing twice as fast as other revenues, and they now represent over $5 trillion of annual revenues for the 3,000 biggest companies that we track.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith sustainable investment, it\u2019s the same story,\u201d Heaps says. \u201cSustainable capital expenditure is growing twice as fast as all other capex.\u201d That green investment is key to a more sustainable future, telling us where companies are going as opposed to where they currently derive their revenues.\n\nThe firms in the 2025 Global 100 ranking allocated 58% of their investments to sustainable projects in 2023, up from 55% in the prior year. That figure compares with sustainable investments of just 15% for the 8,259 other publicly traded companies with revenues of more than $1 billion in the Global 100 universe."

            "article_text": "Methodology: How TIME and Statista Determined the World's Most Sustainable Companies of 2024\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for a company to give lip service to helping the environment; it\u2019s another for its leaders to make trackable, public commitments to doing better for the planet\u2014and follow through on them. For the first time, TIME and data firm Statista have created a rigorous methodology with which to measure the world\u2019s most sustainable companies for 2024. The companies at the top of the list have signed on to some of the most respected climate programs, including the 1.5\u00b0C target from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and receive high scores from CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project). TIME and Statista further held companies to high standards for their Scope 1 and 2 emissions and energy consumption relative to company size, emissions reductions in 2021 and 2022 (the most recent years fully reported), and proportion of renewable energy used by the company\u2019s operations. (Scope 1 emissions are directly caused by a company; Scope 2 are indirectly created when a company purchases power.) And, perhaps most importantly, many of the top companies have incorporated sustainability into their business models.\n\nSchneider Electric, for instance, which is based in France and tops the list, creates software and services for energy management. It has not only set ambitious targets to reduce its own emissions\u2014carbon neutral by 2025\u2014but also helps its customers reduce emissions and become more energy efficient through its Sustainability Business. It has its own sustainability impact program to track its performance, and has also reduced emissions across its supply chain. Schneider has received a climate score of \u201cA\u201d from the CDP for 12 years in a row. \u201cWe\u2019ve positioned the company to be an impact company,\u201d CEO Peter W. Herweck said on a recent earnings call.\n\nWhile many companies that ranked highly are in industries that don\u2019t make many physical products\u2014like banking, tech, and consulting\u2014there were companies that showed sustainability is possible even if you make things. Illumina, the U.S. biotechnology company that's fifth on the list, recently debuted its most powerful gene sequencer while also reducing packaging waste by 90% from the previous model. Moncler, the Italian luxury fashion house, ranked third on the list by using recycled materials, recycling more than 80% of its nylon scraps in 2023, and using 100% renewable energy at its directly managed offices, stores, factories, and logistics hubs. \u201cWhile we take pride in this achievement, we are aware much remains to be done,\u201d said Remo Ruffini, chairman and CEO of Moncler S.p.A, when the company was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices in 2023.\n\nWhile impressive, Schneider\u2019s top score of 88.86 out of 100 on TIME\u2019s list shows the distance even the most dedicated companies have to go to be truly sustainable. See the full list of the world's 500 most sustainable companies below. \u2014Alana Semuels"

For over two decades, we\u2019ve led the way in sustainability reporting, investing in renewable energy, offering sustainable finance and executing the largest number of power purchase agreements in Canada. Recently, we planted our one millionth tree, effectively offsetting all of our paper use and removing carbon from the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\"Integrating sustainability into business strategies globally is a challenge as expectations rise for cost-effective, credible programs with rigorous reporting. At TELUS, we have a consistent vision with ambitious environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals and science-based climate targets. Now, we\u2019re also turning our focus to technology enabled nature-based climate solutions such as AI/GIS integrated tree planting. Our approach is to partner with nature-focused technology innovators, science and research organizations and Indigenous communities and knowledge keepers to ensure the utmost integrity of the environmental solutions we\u2019re offering to our customers.\" - Geoff Pegg, Head of Sustainability at TELUS.\n\nWhy nature restoration?\n\nAccording to research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, nature can provide up to 37% of the emission reductions needed by 2030 to keep global temperature rise under two degrees celsius. With rising ocean temperatures and forests under threat from wildfires, pests and deforestation, there is an urgent need to restore and care for our ecosystems.\n\n\n\nGiving back to the planet can also be good for business: such programs have been proven to help organizations differentiate their ESG programs and operational sustainability. Our consumer research tells us that if an organization has a strong purpose, people are four times more likely to purchase their products and services. According to research led by First Insights, this is especially true for younger consumers: 75% of Gen Z state that sustainability is more important to them than brand name when making purchase decisions.\n\n\n\nFrom replanting wildfire-affected areas to restoring coastal kelp forests - the TELUS Environmental Solutions team and our partners offer a range of natural climate solutions designed to make positive social and environmental impacts in Canada and across the globe.\n\nDrone wildfire reforestation with Flash Forest\n\nFlash Forest harnesses the power of drones to accelerate post-wildfire restoration. In severely burned areas, this speeds up the natural process that would typically take years to recover. Leveraging drone technology, we're able to reach areas deemed unsafe for human tree planters and can plant a range of native tree species so that forests are more resilient in the future.\n\nBlockchain-verified restoration with veritree\n\nKelp forests and mangroves, vital for marine ecosystems, face increasing threats from climate change. The process of seaforestation, utilizing fast-growing kelp, is highly scalable, with 25% of our coastlines suitable for this carbon capturing solution. Proprietary blockchain verification technology enhances transparency and brand trust by ensuring the carbon sequestered by each kelp plant is accurately accounted for and allocated only once.\n\nESG planting with Shakti by TELUS\n\nPlanting trees is one of the leading approaches to addressing the impacts of climate change. Research published in the journal Nature estimates that over 15 billion trees are cut down each year. Shakti by TELUS is an environmentally-focused reforestation company specializing in site preparation, seed collection, tree sourcing and tree planting. We get the right species in the right zone at the right time, supported by custom-built tools and mapping systems.\n\nUnlock the potential of nature investments for your business. Contact us today."

Consolidated operating revenues and other income increased by 3.5 per cent over the same period a year ago to $5.4 billion. This growth was driven by higher service revenue and higher other income from real estate and copper monetization in our TELUS technology solutions (TTech) segment, offset by lower service revenue in our TELUS digital experience segment (TELUS Digital).\n\nWithin TTech, higher revenue from the expansion of mobile, residential internet, TV and security subscribers, health services, agriculture and consumer goods services, were partially offset by rate reductions in mobile network, lower fixed legacy voice and TV services revenues due to technological substitution. The decline in TELUS Digital operating revenues were from lower external revenues reflecting reduced revenue from certain technology and eCommerce clients, partially offset by the favourable foreign currency impact. See Fourth Quarter 2024 Operating Highlights within this news release for a discussion on TTech and TELUS Digital results.\n\n\"In the fourth quarter, our team's relentless pursuit of operational excellence continued to differentiate the TELUS organization, driving significant customer growth and robust financial results,\" said Darren Entwistle, President and CEO. \"Through our premier asset portfolio and unwavering commitment to cost efficiency, we delivered strong profitable growth to close out 2024 - momentum we intend to build upon in 2025. Our focus on margin-accretive customer expansion, globally leading broadband networks, and a customer-centric culture enabled us to achieve industry-best total customer net additions in the fourth quarter of 328,000, with 70,000 mobile phone customer additions, 194,000 connected devices, and 64,000 fixed net additions. Furthermore, this growth culminated in our third consecutive year of surpassing one million mobility and fixed customer additions, with a total of more than 1.2 million new customer additions. This performance is a testament to our unmatched bundled product offerings across Mobile and Home, powered by our PureFibre and wireless broadband networks. Indeed, our team's passion for delivering customer service excellence contributed to continued strong loyalty across our key product lines, once again this quarter. Notably, postpaid mobile phone churn of 0.99 per cent for the full year marks the eleventh consecutive year at less than one per cent.\"\n\n\"Within our global data businesses, our team is delivering strong results. In TELUS Health, our team achieved accelerated revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 10 per cent, fueled by strategic investments with strong execution in acquisitions, products, sales, and distribution channels. We also saw a 20 per cent Adjusted EBITDA contribution growth, driven by increased revenue and a focus on cost controls leveraging both technology and synergy enablers. Since acquiring LifeWorks, we have achieved $355 million in combined annualized synergies, inclusive of $294 million in cost synergies and $61 million in cross-selling, and we remain on track to deliver our stated goal of $427 million by year end 2025. Additionally, we drove a 9.6 per cent year-over-year increase in global lives covered to over 76 million. TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods demonstrated robust performance, with revenue increasing by 16 per cent, supported by increasing profitability and margin contributions. These results underscore our commitment to leveraging our unique global businesses to maximize shareholder value and progress our leadership in social capitalism, and we look forward to continuing the momentum in these businesses in 2025 and beyond.\"\n\nDarren further commented, \"Our strategic investments in our leading broadband network, particularly in our highly valuable fibre and wireless assets, underpin the continued advancement of our financial and operational performance. These investments enable consistent, long-term profitable growth, supported by our unique asset base, customer experience leadership, and world-leading networks. This gives us confidence in the robust outlook for our business and our ability to deliver on the annual targets for 2025 that we announced today. These targets include TTech Operating Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of up to 4 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively; Consolidated Free Cash Flow of approximately $2.15 billion; supported by moderating Consolidated Capital Expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion. Our team's exceptional skill and execution excellence, alongside our attractive Free Cash Growth outlook, underpin our sustainable multi-year dividend growth program, now in its fifteenth year. This is buttressed by one of the lowest industry capital intensity ratios globally, alongside compelling monetization opportunities that we anticipate supporting meaningful deleveraging, also a key area of focus for 2025 and beyond. Indeed, we are targeting to achieve a net debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 3-times in 2027, in conjunction with the contemporaneous removal of the discounted dividend re-investment plan, preceded by a ratcheting down of the plan in 2026. In May, per our established cycle, we will provide an update on our dividend growth program for 2026 through 2028 and, more generally, for the return of capital to shareholders.\"\n\n\"Our TELUS team is equally committed to driving positive social outcomes in our communities,\" continued Darren. \"Demonstrating our passion for making the future friendly, our TELUS team members and retirees volunteered 1.5 million hours, globally, in 2024, marking our eighth consecutive year surpassing one million volunteer hours and making 2024 our most giving year ever. Since 2000, our TELUS family has volunteered 2.4 million days of giving \u2013 more than any other company in the world.\"\n\nDoug French, Executive Vice-president and CFO, said, \"Our fourth quarter results underscore our consistent operational execution amidst a dynamic environment. We achieved TTech operating revenue growth of 4.1 per cent driven by mobile equipment and fixed data revenue growth, as well as strong financial contributions from our health and agriculture and consumer goods lines of service. Notably, TTech Adjusted EBITDA increased by 7 per cent in the fourth quarter, and for the full year, TTech Adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.5 per cent, achieving the low end of our full year target, demonstrating our unparalleled track record of execution excellence. This growth was driven by our consistent emphasis on profitable customer growth, the benefits from our ongoing focus on cost efficiency and effectiveness, gains from our real estate and copper monetization program, as well as increasing margin contribution from TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods. Free cash flow of approximately $2.0 billion was slightly below our updated full year target from the effects of contract asset and device financing, associated with our strong growth in contracted volumes, and increased restructuring payments. This was partially offset by lower capital expenditures, which came in below our full year target.\"\n\n\"Our financial and balance sheet position remains healthy as we begin 2025. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $2.9 billion of available liquidity, an average cost of long-term debt of 4.37 per cent, and an average term to maturity of long-term debt of more than 10 years. We expect our net debt to EBITDA ratio to improve in 2025, supported by sustainable EBITDA growth and prudent capital allocation initiatives.\"\n\n\"For 2025, we are confident in driving strong, sustainable growth despite a competitive market, supported by our robust asset mix and resilient business strategy. We anticipate continued free cash flow expansion underpinned by strong EBITDA growth and stable capital expenditures as we drive towards the 10 per cent capital intensity level. Our asset monetization opportunities, including our ongoing real estate and copper initiatives, as well as other strategic levers, will support our deleveraging plans and ensures we remain well-equipped to deliver strong, sustainable growth well into the future,\" concluded Doug.\n\nAs compared to the same period a year ago, net income in the quarter of $320 million was up 3.2 per cent and Basic earnings per share (EPS) of $0.24 increased by 20 per cent. These increases were driven by the after-tax impacts of growth in operating income partially offset by an increase in financing costs, driven by the impact of unrealized changes in virtual power purchase agreements forward element and higher interest expense.\n\nAs it relates to EPS, the increase also reflects the effect of a higher number of Common shares outstanding. When excluding certain costs and other adjustments (see 'Reconciliation of adjusted Net income' in this news release), adjusted net income of $380 million increased by 11 per cent over the same period last year, while adjusted basic EPS of $0.25 was up 4.2 per cent over the same period last year. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure and adjusted basic EPS is a non-GAAP ratio. For further explanation of these measures, see 'Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures' in this news release.\n\nCompared to the same period last year, consolidated EBITDA increased by 3.7 per cent to approximately $1.8 billion and reflects lower restructuring and other costs, primarily related to significant investments in cost efficiency and effectiveness programs, inclusive of real estate rationalization. Adjusted EBITDA decreased modestly by 0.6 per cent to more than $1.8 billion and reflects: (i) mobile, residential internet, security, and TV subscriber growth (excluding the first quarter 2024 Pik TV subscriber base adjustment); (ii) broad-based cost reduction efforts, including workforce reductions, synergies achieved between LifeWorks and our legacy health business, and increased adoption of TELUS Digital's solutions across TTech operations, resulting in competitive benefits given the lower cost structure in TELUS Digital, as well as reductions in administrative and marketing costs; (iii) higher gains on real estate and increases in reversals of business combination-related provision; (iv) higher health services margin; and (v) higher agriculture and consumer goods margins. These factors were partly offset by: (i) lower mobile phone ARPU; (ii) declining fixed legacy voice and TV margins; (iii) an increase in bad debt expense; (iv) higher network operations costs; (v) increased costs of subscription-based licences and cloud usage; and (vi) lower TELUS Digital Adjusted EBITDA driven in part by higher investments in corporate initiatives, such as expansion of its commercial sales team and operational effectiveness programs.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we added 328,000 net customer additions, down 76,000 over the same period last year, and inclusive of 70,000 mobile phones and 194,000 connected devices, in addition to 37,000 internet, 27,000 TV and 10,000 security customer connections. This was partly offset by residential voice losses of 10,000. Our total TTech subscriber base of 20.2 million is up 5.9 per cent over the last twelve months, reflecting a 3.5 per cent increase in our mobile phones subscriber base to over 10.1 million and a 20 per cent increase in our connected devices subscriber base to over 3.7 million. Additionally, our internet connections grew by 5.1 per cent over the last twelve months to approximately 2.8 million customer connections, our TV customer base stands at approximately 1.4 million customer connections, and our security subscriber base increased by 6.1 per cent to more than 1.1 million customer connections. Our residential voice subscriber base declined slightly by 3.3 per cent to more than 1.0 million.\n\nIn health services, as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, virtual care members were 6.5 million and healthcare lives covered were 76.2 million, up 16 per cent and 9.6 per cent over the past twelve months, respectively. Digital health transactions in the fourth quarter of 2024 were 169.8 million, up 7.5 per cent over the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nCash provided by operating activities of $1.1 billion decreased by 18 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily driven by other working capital changes and an increase in income taxes paid, net, partially offset by increased EBITDA.\n\nFree cash flow of $534 million decreased by 10 per cent compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting the timing related to device subsidy repayments and associated revenue recognition and our TELUS Easy Payment device financing program, increased income taxes paid, and increased interest paid. These factors were partly offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nConsolidated capital expenditures of $551 million, increased by $18 million or 3.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase primarily reflects TTech real estate development capital expenditures of $128 million, which increased by $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. This was partially offset by TTech operations, which drove a $58 million decrease in the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily as a result of the planned slowdown of our fibre and wireless network builds. TELUS Digital capital expenditures increased by $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily driven by increased spend in the development and enablement of Fuel iX\u2122 and AI platforms and customer experience facilities expansion.\n\nAs at December 31, 2024, our 5G network covered approximately 32.3 million Canadians, representing over 87 per cent of the population.\n\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\n\nC$ millions, except footnotes and unless noted otherwise Three months ended\n\nDecember 31 Per cent (unaudited) 2024 2023 change Operating revenues (arising from contracts with customers) 5,331 5,156 3.4 Operating revenues and other income 5,381 5,198 3.5 Total operating expenses 4,622 4,534 1.9 Net income 320 310 3.2 Net income attributable to common shares 358 288 24.3 Adjusted Net income(1) 380 341 11.4 Basic EPS ($) 0.24 0.20 20.0 Adjusted basic EPS(1) ($) 0.25 0.24 4.2 EBITDA(1) 1,770 1,705 3.7 Adjusted EBITDA(1) 1,838 1,847 (0.6) Capital expenditures(2) 551 533 3.4 Cash provided by operating activities 1,077 1,314 (18.0) Free cash flow(1) 534 595 (10.3) Total telecom subscriber connections(3) (thousands) 20,175 19,056 5.9 Healthcare lives covered (millions) 76.2 69.5 9.6\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) These are non-GAAP and other specified financial measures, which do not have standardized meanings under IFRS Accounting Standards and might not be comparable to those used by other issuers.

Refer to Note 31 of the consolidated financial statements for further information. (3) The sum of active mobile phone subscribers, connected device subscribers, internet subscribers, residential voice subscribers, TV subscribers and security subscribers, measured at the end of the respective periods based on information in billing and other source systems. Effective for the first quarter of 2024, with retrospective application to January 1, 2023, we reduced our mobile phone subscriber base by 283,000 subscribers to remove a subset of our public services customers that are now subject to dynamic pricing auction models. We believe adjusting our base for these low margin customers provides a more meaningful reflection of the underlying performance of our mobile phone business and our focus on profitable growth. As a result of this change, associated operating statistics (ARPU and churn) have also been adjusted. Effective January 1, 2024, on a prospective basis, we adjusted our TV subscriber base to remove 97,000 subscribers, as we have ceased marketing our Pik TV\u00ae product.\n\nFourth Quarter 2024 Operating Highlights\n\nTELUS technology solutions (TTech)\n\nTTech operating revenues (arising from contracts with customers) increased by $180 million or 4.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting increases in mobile equipment and other service revenues, fixed data services revenues, fixed equipment and other service revenues, health services and agriculture and consumer goods services, as described below.

Decreases in fixed voice services revenues and mobile network revenue were partial offsets. TTech EBITDA increased by $194 million or 13 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, while TTech Adjusted EBITDA increased by $113 million or 7.0 per cent, reflecting: (i) mobile, residential internet, security, and TV subscriber growth (excluding the first quarter 2024 Pik TV subscriber base adjustment); (ii) broad-based cost reduction efforts, including workforce reductions, synergies achieved between LifeWorks and our legacy health business, and increased adoption of TELUS Digital's solutions across TTech operations, resulting in competitive benefits given the lower cost structure in TELUS Digital, as well as reduction in administrative and marketing costs; (iii) higher gains on real estate projects; (iv) higher health services margin; and (v) higher agriculture and consumer goods margins. These factors were partially offset by: (i) lower mobile phone ARPU; (ii) higher bad debt expense; (iii) declining fixed legacy voice and TV margins; (iv) lower mobile equipment margins; (v) higher network operations costs; and (vi) increased subscription-based licences and cloud usage costs.\n\nMobile products and services\n\nMobile network revenue decreased by $1 million or 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, largely due to lower mobile phone ARPU, offset by growth in our mobile phone subscriber base and an increase in IoT connections.\n\nor 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, largely due to lower mobile phone ARPU, offset by growth in our mobile phone subscriber base and an increase in IoT connections.

TTech mobile products and services direct contribution decreased by $34 million or 2.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, largely reflecting the impact of lower mobile phone ARPU, higher amortization of deferred commissions attributable to growth in retail traffic in the fourth quarter and prior periods, and lower mobile equipment margin from increased discounting, despite higher contracted volume.

These factors were partly offset by mobile phone subscriber growth. Mobile phone ARPU was $58.05 in the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting a decrease of $2.15 or 3.6 per cent, attributable to the adoption of base rate plans with lower prices in response to more intense marketing and promotional price competition targeting both new and existing customers, and a decline in overage and roaming revenues, partly offset by higher IoT revenue. We are seeing a continuing increase in the adoption of unlimited data and Canada-U.S.- Mexico plans which provide higher and more stable ARPU on a monthly basis while also giving customers cost certainty in lower roaming fees to the U.S. and Mexico and lower data overage fees, respectively.\n\nin the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting a decrease of or 3.6 per cent, attributable to the adoption of base rate plans with lower prices in response to more intense marketing and promotional price competition targeting both new and existing customers, and a decline in overage and roaming revenues, partly offset by higher IoT revenue.

Mobile phone gross additions were 523,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting a decrease of 22,000, driven by decelerating growth in the Canadian population and a greater emphasis on premium and profitable loading, partly offset by our shift to digital loading. The deceleration in immigration growth, observed later in 2024, is limiting our ability to add to our subscriber base.\n\nMobile phone net additions were 70,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting a decrease of 56,000, driven by a higher mobile phone churn rate and lower mobile phone gross additions.\n\nOur mobile phone churn rate was 1.50 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 1.44 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, largely as a result of customer switching decisions in response to more intense marketing and promotional price competition, in addition to an increase in the adoption of BYOD plans. These factors have been partly mitigated by our continued focus on customer retention and our industry-leading service and network quality, along with successful promotions and bundled offerings.\n\nConnected device net additions were 194,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024, and were largely comparable to the 203,000 net additions in the prior year.\n\nFixed products and services\n\nFixed data services revenues increased by $40 million or 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by growth in our internet, security and TV subscriber bases.

TTech fixed products and services direct contribution increased by $65 million or 5.0 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily driven by continued internet and security subscriber growth, growth in health services revenue, and increased agriculture and consumer goods revenues. These were partly offset by declines in legacy voice and TV margins attributable to technological substitution.\n\nor 5.0 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily driven by continued internet and security subscriber growth, growth in health services revenue, and increased agriculture and consumer goods revenues. These were partly offset by declines in legacy voice and TV margins attributable to technological substitution. Internet net additions were 37,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting an increase of 1,000, attributable to driving strong gross additions through robust sales strategies and the strength of our fibre optic offering. These factors were partly offset by a slightly elevated churn rate.\n\nTV net additions were 27,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting an increase of 4,000, attributable to our diverse offerings, which address the changing needs and preferences of consumers, partially offset by a higher churn rate due to the same factors also impacting internet net additions.\n\nSecurity net additions were 10,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting a decrease of 13,000, primarily due to a higher churn rate related to an increased mix of self-monitored plans in our subscriber base and modestly lower gross additions.\n\nResidential voice net losses were 10,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting an increase of 3,000 losses. Our bundled product and lower-priced offerings have been successful in mitigating losses and minimizing substitution to mobile and internet-based services.\n\nHealth services\n\nThrough TELUS Health, we are leveraging technology to deliver connected solutions and services, improving access to care and revolutionizing the flow of information while facilitating collaboration, efficiency, and productivity across the healthcare ecosystem, progressing our vision of transforming healthcare and empowering people to live healthier lives.\n\nHealth services revenues increased by $43 million or 10 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily driven by business acquisitions related to employee and family assistance programs and organic growth, virtual pharmacy sales, and an increase in the demand for health benefits management services and retirement benefits solutions.\n\nor 10 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily driven by business acquisitions related to employee and family assistance programs and organic growth, virtual pharmacy sales, and an increase in the demand for health benefits management services and retirement benefits solutions.

Policies and approaches advanced by elected officials and regulatory decisions, reviews and other government activity may have strategic, operational and/or financial impacts (including on revenue and free cash flow) .\n\n\n\nRisks and uncertainties include: potential changes to our regulatory regime or the outcomes of proceedings, cases or inquiries relating to its application, including, but not limited to, those set out in Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings in our 2024 MD&A; our ability to comply with complex and changing regulation of the healthcare, virtual care and medical devices industries in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including as an operator of health clinics; and our ability to comply with, or facilitate our clients' compliance with, numerous, complex and sometimes conflicting legal regimes, both domestically and internationally.\n\n. . Risks and uncertainties include: Competitive environment . Competitor expansion, activity and intensity (pricing, including discounting, bundling), as well as non-traditional competition, disruptive technology and disintermediation, may alter the nature of the markets in which we compete and impact our market share and financial results (including revenue and free cash flow ). TELUS Digital, TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods also face intense competition in their respective different markets.\n\n. ). Technology . Consumer adoption of alternative technologies and changing customer expectations have the potential to impact our revenue streams and customer churn rates .\n\n\n\nRisks and uncertainties include: disruptive technologies, including software-defined networks in the business market, that may displace or cause us to reprice our existing data services, and self-installed technology solutions; any failure to innovate, maintain technological advantages or respond effectively and in a timely manner to changes in technology; the roll-out, anticipated benefits and efficiencies, and ongoing evolution of wireless broadband technologies and systems; our reliance on wireless network access agreements, which have facilitated our deployment of mobile technologies; our expected long-term need to acquire additional spectrum through future spectrum auctions and from third parties to meet growing demand for data, and our ability to utilize spectrum we acquire; deployment and operation of new fixed broadband network technologies at a reasonable cost and the availability and success of new products and services to be rolled out using such network technologies; and our deployment of self-learning tools and automation, which may change the way we interact with customers.\n\n. . Risks and uncertainties include: Security and data protection . Our ability to detect and identify potential threats and vulnerabilities depends on the effectiveness of our security controls in protecting our infrastructure and operating environment, and our timeliness in responding to attacks and restoring business operations. A successful attack may impede the operations of our network or lead to the unauthorized access to, interception, destruction, use or dissemination of, customer, team member or business information .\n\n. . Generative AI (GenAI) . GenAI exposes us to numerous risks, including risks related to the operational reliability, responsible AI usage, data privacy and cybersecurity, and the possibility that our use of AI may generate inaccurate or inappropriate content or create negative perceptions among customers, and regulation could also affect future implementation that could affect demand for our services.\n\n. Climate and the environment . Natural disasters, pandemics, disruptive events and climate change may impact our operations, customer satisfaction and team member experience .\n\nOur goals to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our operations are subject to our ability to identify, procure and implement solutions that reduce energy consumption and adopt cleaner sources of energy, our ability to identify and make suitable investments in renewable energy, including in the form of virtual power purchase agreements, and our ability to continue to realize significant absolute reductions in energy use and the resulting GHG emissions from our operations.\n\n. . Our goals to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our operations are subject to our ability to identify, procure and implement solutions that reduce energy consumption and adopt cleaner sources of energy, our ability to identify and make suitable investments in renewable energy, including in the form of virtual power purchase agreements, and our ability to continue to realize significant absolute reductions in energy use and the resulting GHG emissions from our operations. Operational performance and business combination . Investments and acquisitions present opportunities to expand our operational scope, but may expose us to new risks. We may be unsuccessful in gaining market traction/share and realizing benefits, and integration efforts may divert resources from other priorities .\n\n\n\nRisks include: our reliance on third-party cloud-based computing services to deliver our IT services; and economic, political and other risks associated with doing business globally (including war and other geopolitical developments).\n\n. Risks include: Our systems and processes . Systems and technology innovation, maintenance and management may impact our IT systems and network reliability, as well as our operating costs .\n\n\n\nRisks and uncertainties include: our ability to maintain customer service and operate our network in the event of human error or human-caused threats, such as cyberattacks and equipment failures that could cause network outages; technical disruptions and infrastructure breakdowns; delays and rising costs, including as a result of government restrictions or trade actions; and the completeness and effectiveness of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and responses.\n\n. . Risks and uncertainties include: Our team . The rapidly evolving and highly competitive nature of our markets and operating environment, along with the globalization and evolving demographic profile of our workforce, and the effectiveness of our internal training, development, succession and health and well-being programs, may impact our ability to attract, develop and retain team members with the skills required to meet the changing needs of our customers and our business. Team members may face greater mental health challenges associated with the significant change initiatives at the organization, which may result in the loss of key team members through short-term and long-term disability . Integration of international business acquisitions and concurrent integration activities may impact operational efficiency, organizational culture and engagement .\n\n. . . Suppliers . We may be impacted by supply chain disruptions and lack of resiliency in relation to global or local events. Dependence on a single supplier for products, components, service delivery or support may impact our ability to efficiently meet constantly changing and rising customer expectations while maintaining quality of service . Our suppliers' ability to maintain and service their product lines could affect the success of upgrades to, and evolution of, technology that we offer.\n\n. . Real estate matters . Real estate investments are exposed to possible financing risks and uncertainty related to future demand, occupancy and rental rates, especially following the pandemic. Future real estate developments may not be completed on budget or on time and may not obtain lease commitments as planned .\n\n. . Financing, debt and dividends . Our ability to access funding at optimal pricing may be impacted by general market conditions and changing assessments in the fixed-income and equity capital markets regarding our ability to generate sufficient future cash flow to service our debt. Our current intention to pay dividends to shareholders could constrain our ability to invest in our operations to support future growth .\n\n\n\nRisks and uncertainties include: our ability to use equity as a form of consideration in business acquisitions is impacted by stock market valuations of TELUS Common Shares and TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subordinate voting shares; our capital expenditure levels and potential outlays for spectrum licences in auctions or purchases from third parties affect and are affected by: our broadband initiatives; our ongoing deployment of newer mobile technologies; investments in network technology required to comply with laws and regulations relating to the security of cyber systems, including bans on the products and services of certain vendors; investments in network resiliency and reliability; the allocation of resources to acquisitions and future spectrum auctions held by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED). Our capital expenditure levels could be impacted if we do not achieve our targeted operational and financial results or if there are changes to our regulatory environment; and lower than planned free cash flow could constrain our ability to invest in operations, reduce leverage or return capital to shareholders. Quarterly dividend decisions are made by our Board of Directors based on our financial position and outlook. There can be no assurance that our dividend growth program will be maintained through 2025 or renewed. our plan to reduce the discount offered under dividend re-investment plan in 2026 and to eliminate the discount contemporaneously with achieving a net debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 3 times in 2027 is also subject to the evaluation of this metric, general market conditions and our financial condition by our Board of Directors. TELUS Digital's ability to achieve targets or other guidance regarding its business, which if not achieved could affect TELUS' ability to achieve targets for the organization as a whole and could result in a decline in the trading price of the TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subordinate voting shares or the TELUS Common Shares or both. Factors that may affect TELUS Digital's financial performance are described in TELUS International (Cda) Inc. public filings available on SEDAR+ and EDGAR.\n\n. . Risks and uncertainties include: Tax matters . Complexity of domestic and foreign tax laws, regulations and reporting requirements that apply to TELUS and our international operating subsidiaries may impact financial results. International acquisitions and expansion of operations heighten our exposure to multiple forms of taxation .\n\n. . The economy . Changing global economic conditions, including a potential recession and alternating expectations about inflation, as well as our effectiveness in monitoring and revising growth assumptions and contingency plans, may impact the achievement of our corporate objectives, our financial results (including free cash flow), and our defined benefit pension plans . Geopolitical uncertainties and potential tariffs or non-tariff trade actions present a risk of recession and may cause customers to reduce or delay discretionary spending, impacting new service purchases or volumes of use, and consider substitution by lower-priced alternatives .\n\n. . . Litigation and legal matters . Complexity of, and compliance with, laws, regulations, commitments and expectations may have a financial and reputational impact .\n\n\n\nRisks include: our ability to defend against existing and potential claims or our ability to negotiate and exercise indemnity rights or other protections in respect of such claims; and the complexity of legal compliance in domestic and foreign jurisdictions, including compliance with competition, anti-bribery and foreign corrupt practices laws.\n\n. . Risks include:\n\nThe assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are described in additional detail in Section 9 General trends, outlook and assumptions, and regulatory developments and proceedings and Section 10 Risks and risk management in our 2024 annual MD&A. Those descriptions are incorporated by reference in this cautionary statement but are not intended to be a complete list of the risks that could affect the Company, or of our assumptions.\n\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, financial performance, cash flows, business or reputation. Except as otherwise indicated in this document, the forward-looking statements made herein do not reflect the potential impact of any non-recurring or special items or any mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other business combinations or transactions that may be announced or that may occur after the date of this document.\n\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this document describe our expectations, and are based on our assumptions, as at the date of this document and are subject to change after this date. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law.\n\nThis cautionary statement qualifies all of the forward-looking statements in this document.\n\nNon-GAAP and other specified financial measures\n\nWe have issued guidance on and report certain non-GAAP measures that are used to evaluate the performance of TELUS, as well as to determine compliance with debt covenants and to manage our capital structure. As non-GAAP measures generally do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. For certain financial metrics, there are definitional differences between TELUS and TELUS Digital Experience reporting. These differences largely arise from TELUS Digital adopting definitions consistent with practice in its industry. Securities regulations require such measures to be clearly defined, qualified and reconciled with their nearest GAAP measure. Certain of the metrics do not have generally accepted industry definitions.\n\nAdjusted Net income and adjusted basic earnings per share (EPS): These are non-GAAP measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Adjusted Net income excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related adjustments, long-term debt prepayment premium and other adjustments (identified in the following tables). Effective for 2024, with retrospective application, we have revised our definition of adjusted Net income to remove other equity (income) losses related to real estate joint ventures to conform with the way management currently evaluates performance. Adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated as adjusted net income divided by basic weighted-average common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate performance at a consolidated level and exclude items that, in management's view, may obscure underlying trends in business performance or items of an unusual nature that do not reflect our ongoing operations. They should not be considered alternatives to Net income and basic earnings per share in measuring TELUS' performance.\n\nReconciliation of adjusted Net income\n\n\n\nThree months ended\n\nDecember 31 C$ and in millions 2024 2023 Net income attributable to Common Shares 358 288 Add (deduct) amounts net of amount attributable to non-controlling interests:\n\n\n\nRestructuring and other costs 60 140 Tax effects of restructuring and other costs (13) (37) Real estate rationalization-related restructuring impairments (20) 8 Tax effect of real estate rationalization-related restructuring impairments 5 (2) Income tax-related adjustments (11) (13) Unrealized changes in virtual power purchase agreements forward element 3 (59) Tax effect of unrealized changes in virtual power purchase agreements forward element (2) 16 Adjusted Net income 380 341\n\nReconciliation of adjusted basic EPS\n\n\n\nThree months ended\n\nDecember 31 C$ 2024 2023 Basic EPS 0.24 0.20 Add (deduct) amounts net of amount attributable to non-controlling interests:\n\n\n\nRestructuring and other costs, per share 0.04 0.09 Tax effect of restructuring and other costs, per share (0.01) (0.02) Real estate rationalization-related restructuring impairments, per share (0.01) 0.01 Income tax-related adjustments, per share (0.01) (0.01) Unrealized changes in virtual power purchase agreements forward element, per share \u2014 (0.04) Tax effect of unrealized changes in virtual power purchase agreements forward element \u2014 0.01 Adjusted basic EPS 0.25 0.24\n\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization): We have issued guidance on and report EBITDA because it is a key measure used to evaluate performance at a consolidated level. EBITDA is commonly reported and widely used by investors and lending institutions as an indicator of a company's operating performance and ability to incur and service debt, and as a valuation metric. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to Net income in measuring TELUS' performance, nor should it be used as a measure of cash flow. EBITDA as calculated by TELUS is equivalent to Operating revenues and other income less the total of Goods and services purchased expense and Employee benefits expense.\n\nWe also calculate Adjusted EBITDA to exclude items of an unusual nature that do not reflect our ongoing operations and should not, in our opinion, be considered in a long-term valuation metric or should not be included in an assessment of our ability to service or incur debt.\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTech TELUS Digital Eliminations Total Three-month periods ended December 31 (C$ millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n320 310 Financing costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n321 278 Income taxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n118 76 EBIT 768 535 7 129 (16) \u2014 759 664 Depreciation 562 615 56 50 \u2014 \u2014 618 665 Amortization of intangible assets 330 316 63 60 \u2014 \u2014 393 376 EBITDA 1,660 1,466 126 239 (16) \u2014 1,770 1,705 Add restructuring and other costs included in EBITDA 51 132 17 10 \u2014 \u2014 68 142 Adjusted EBITDA 1,711 1,598 143 249 (16) \u2014 1,838 1,847\n\nAdjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures is calculated for our reportable segments, as it represents a performance measure that may be more comparable to similar measurees presented by other issuers.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures reconciliation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTech TELUS Digital Eliminations Total Three-month periods ended December 31 (C$ millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 Adjusted EBITDA 1,711 1,598 143 249 (16) \u2014 1,838 1,847 Capital expenditures (520) (497) (47) (36) 16 \u2014 (551) (533) Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures 1,191 1,101 96 213 \u2014 \u2014 1,287 1,314\n\nFree cash flow: We report this measure as a supplementary indicator of our operating performance, and there is no generally accepted industry definition of free cash flow. It should not be considered as an alternative to the measures in the Consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow excludes certain working capital changes (such as trade receivables and trade payables), proceeds from divested assets and other sources and uses of cash, as reported in the Consolidated statements of cash flows. It provides an indication of how much cash generated by operations is available after capital expenditures that may be used to, among other things, pay dividends, repay debt, purchase shares or make other investments. We exclude impacts of accounting standards that do not impact cash, such as IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.

Additionally, as the title partner of the Canadian Championship \u2013 the exclusive pathway for Canadian clubs to the CONCACAF Champions League \u2013TELUS is not just sponsoring, it is actively fostering the growth of soccer. The company's involvement supports the sport's development locally and contributes to its global reach, creating new opportunities for youth engagement and stimulating economic benefits through increased sports participation and event hosting. TELUS is also the title sponsor of the SheCan Coach program, a national coach recruitment, development and training program with the goal of ensuring more women and girls can enjoy the benefits of soccer by addressing the current challenges that they face relating to participation. In April 2023 TELUS partnered with the Canadian Premier League (CPL) and rallied Canadians to support those in need by collecting gently used equipment with all 8 CPL teams and redistributing the items collected to underprivileged communities nationwide, helping to create opportunities for soccer participation in Canada while inspiring youth to reach their full potential through sport.\n\nInnovating for a more sustainable future TELUS' 2023 Sustainability and ESG Report highlights its significant efforts and progress to meet the company's ambitious goal to use 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2025. Notably, TELUS has issued six sustainability-linked bonds since 2021 totaling CAD 3.7 billion and USD 900 million , tying the progress on reaching its science-based operational decarbonization goals to its financing needs. The company's dedication to environmental goals has earned it a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 23 rd consecutive year. Notably, TELUS offers internet and mobile connectivity to allow its customers to live, work, learn, shop and see a doctor - virtually - from anywhere, thereby reducing unnecessary commuting and helping its customers transition to a low-carbon, nature-positive future.

This includes the TELUS Greater Toronto & Hamilton Area Community Board granting $850,000 to support 50 exceptional youth charities, 12 health programs and 38 education programs in 2023 In 2023, the TELUS Ottawa & Eastern Ontario Community Board granted $400,000 to support 24 exceptional youth charities, 9 health programs and 15 education programs, surpassing awarding 600 grants to grassroots organizations impacting youth in their region.\n\nAdvancing its commitment to reconciliation In July 2023 , TELUS announced a doubling of its commitment to the TELUS Indigenous Communities Fund from $1 million to $2 million over the next five years. The fund offers grants for Indigenous-led social, health and community programs. Since its inception in November 2021 , TELUS has distributed $575,000 in cash donations to 29 community programs supporting food security, education, cultural and linguistic revitalization, wildfire relief efforts, and the health, mental-health and well-being of Indigenous Peoples across Canada . In November 2023 , TELUS was named as part of the Indigenomics 10 to Watch list for its leadership in furthering the growth of the $100 billion Indigenous economy. This award was presented during the Indigenomics on Bay Street event, which brings together leaders from the financial sector, governments and Indigenous businesses to advance economic reconciliation.\n\n\n\nFrom 2000 through 2023, TELUS has invested $259 billion nationally in network infrastructure, operations and spectrum, including more than $68 billion in Ontario.
