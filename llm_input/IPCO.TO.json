            "article_text": "Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and the ratings that underpin it have lost their lustre. That may be no bad thing for companies in the energy and natural resources sectors. When it comes to the big strategic questions they face around decarbonisation over the coming decades, ESG offers limited useful insight.\n\nHowever, the fundamentals of climate change have not shifted, and its threats have not diminished. Now more than ever, companies and their stakeholders need to understand and evaluate how they are positioned to navigate the energy transition \u2013 both the risks and opportunities.\n\nWood Mackenzie\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Index goes beyond ESG to provide a nuanced assessment of corporate positioning in the face of a changing world. It is more relevant to how companies in energy and mining manage their business and a more useful measure of how they stack up against one another.\n\nWe\u2019ll be delving into our Corporate Sustainability Index in detail in a webinar on 26 March, entitled Beyond ESG: Measuring corporate sustainability in an uncertain world. Read on for an outline of why you should sign up and fill in the form to sign up.\n\nESG\u2019s fundamental problem\n\nThe once seemingly inexorable rise of ESG investing has ground to a halt. The term itself \u2013 politicised and weaponised in some quarters \u2013 is fast disappearing from corporate messaging.\n\nBut the issues that ESG purported to address, and the need for companies and stakeholders to act on them, have not gone away. That\u2019s especially true in oil and gas, power and renewables, and metals and mining \u2013 sectors in which the \u2018E\u2019 part of the equation concerns existential matters.\n\nNow more than ever, companies and stakeholders in those sectors need to answer the question \u2013 How are we positioned to navigate decarbonisation and the energy transition \u2013 both risks and opportunities \u2013 over the coming decades?\n\nA key challenge for ESG, particularly in energy and natural resources, is that ESG ratings do not answer that question. They are, by definition, too narrow in scope to fully assess the potential impacts of a changing world. And yet, even within that narrow scope, too broad, simplistic and confused to offer meaningful insight into company-specific risk.\n\nESG ratings have their place, of course. But on that fundamental question, they will only ever be a high-level starting point, at best.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed?\n\nWhat\u2019s needed to answer that question is a detailed, nuanced approach that presents a comprehensive picture. An approach which includes the salient aspects of ESG \u2013 carbon emissions in particular \u2013 but goes much deeper. Which ignores the parts of ESG that are less relevant \u2013 the \u2018S\u2019 part of the equation for example (important for stakeholder management, but not a material factor in transition and decarbonisation strategy). But incorporates the critically important element that ESG misses altogether \u2013 fundamental analysis of the businesses that will see companies through transition (or not).\n\nThat\u2019s the approach taken by Wood Mackenzie\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Index, which spans the most crucial aspects of corporate sustainability. Our index maps to three pillars: i) \u2018transition\u2019 assesses carbon exposure and transition strategy; ii) \u2018portfolio\u2019 assesses the quality, longevity, and resilience of underlying businesses; and iii) \u2018platform\u2019 assesses financial position.\n\nOur Corporate Sustainability Index takes a very different approach to ESG ratings and presents a very different picture. Its central philosophy is that there are many routes to corporate sustainability; there is no one-size-fits-all approach. It rates all companies against all dimensions of sustainability, irrespective of portfolio and strategy, independent of scenarios. And, unlike ESG indices, the Corporate Sustainability Index is underpinned by measures of value, by proprietary, forward-looking commercial analysis, built from asset-level up.\n\nWood Mackenzie\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Index brings clarity. It is a framework within which to understand and benchmark companies on a consistent basis across the key dimensions of sustainability. A tool to highlight strengths and weaknesses, to inform strategic planning, and to gauge the impact of corporate actions. A means to measure the progress of companies in strengthening sustainability in the face of an uncertain future.\n\nNo other index is comparable. None is as comprehensive in scope, as pointed in its focus on the crucial questions or as grounded in detailed analysis.\n\nTo learn more about our Corporate Sustainability Index, sign up for our webinar on 26 March."

            "article_text": "What impact will the incoming Trump administration have on ESG and DEI issues, especially around corporate regulations and government agencies? Expect more executive orders, and much less federal rulemaking\n\nThe impact of the recent US Presidential election on environmental, social & governance (ESG) matters is expected to be wide-ranging, with a broad pullback expected in federal rulemaking, alongside the reversal of several policies. However, legislation by certain US states, such as California, will remain in force, as will international rules requiring compliance from large US-based companies.\n\nPresident-Elect Donald Trump, a strong proponent of increasing fossil fuel production, will almost certainly pull the United States, once again, out of the Paris Climate Accords. His election has already cast a pall over international negotiations at COP29, the annual United Nations climate summit, in Baku, Azerbaijan. As of press time, countries at the summit were struggling to secure a climate finance deal that would support poorer countries in combating climate change.\n\n\u201cOverall, the outcome of the US election win is a dangerous moment for climate action because of its chilling effect on federal, global, and corporate action,\u201d says Dr. Andrew Coburn, CEO of Risilience, a UK-based sustainability intelligence firm. \u201cHowever, the world looks very different from 2016, and there are nuances that will soften the impact.\u201d\n\nFor example, there will be less regulatory pressure for US companies to show action toward their climate goals, but for large corporations \u2014 both multinational and domestic \u2014 regulation from the European Union and the State of California will \u201cmean they still have to engage in stringent climate disclosures,\u201d Coburn adds.\n\nIncreased executive orders on oil, environmental protection, diversity\n\nMany experts have said they believe one way that Trump will act quickly on environmental, social and other policy objectives is by issuing executive orders. The use of such orders is a strategy that many US presidents have used early in their term, offering them an easy way to bypass Congressional negotiations and legislation.\n\nPeter Alpert, partner at the law firm Ropes & Gray in New York City, recently joined colleagues in a roundtable discussion about the outlook for ESG policies under a second Trump administration. \u201cSubstantively, I think that you\u2019d see executive orders on the topic of extraction of fossil fuels \u2014 \u2018drill, baby, drill\u2019 type of executive orders,\u201d says Alpert, adding that there may also be a directive that could impact the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nTrump\u2019s nominee to lead the EPA is Lee Zeldin, a former member of Congress. Zeldin, who ran for New York State governor two years ago, is a lawyer with little climate or environmental experience. In comments made after his nomination, Zeldin said publicly that he would prioritize \u201cunleashing economic prosperity through the EPA\u201d and pursue \u201cenergy dominance,\u201d a phrase used to refer to developing more oil and gas.\n\nYou can hear more about what impact the Trump Administration will have on trade and regulations in the latest Thomson Reuters Institute Insights podcast on Spotify.\n\nRegarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), observers expect the new administration to issue executive orders quickly. Doug Brayley, of Ropes & Gray, said he expects \u201cexecutive orders over the topics that the executive has the most direct control over, and that\u2019s namely the staffing of the federal government, which, of course, employs millions and millions of Americans in civilian capacities and also [manages] federal contractor compliance.\u201d\n\nBrayley cited Project 2025, produced by the Heritage Foundation, an American conservative activist group, that is said to be an explicit blueprint for the new Trump administration. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in Project 2025 [that] there\u2019s a plan to purge the federal bureaucracy of a number of senior civil servants,\u201d Brayley explains. \u201cOne, I think, can reasonably expect senior DEI officials at the various agencies to be included.\u201d\n\nLittle hope of resurrecting SEC climate rule\n\nTrump has yet to nominate a new chair for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; however, whomever he chooses will almost certainly eliminate or severely truncate the climate disclosure rules put forward by current SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Gensler has said publicly that he would step down from his role in January when Trump takes over.\n\nThe climate disclosure regulation, sharply criticized and challenged in court, is now languishing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit after the SEC put a stay on the rules.\n\nIn an analysis of likely financial regulation under the Trump administration, consulting firm PwC stated: \u201cThe SEC\u2019s climate risk disclosures are not likely to go into effect during the new Trump Administration, as they are already facing a difficult legal battle that a new chair could choose not to fight.\u201d\n\nOn the state level, the California legislature formally declined to delay the sustainability reporting regulations contained in its Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (known as SB253) in August, and the law remains in effect even while being challenged in court. The law, previously signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, means that both public and private companies that meet certain revenue thresholds and \u201cdo business\u201d in California should prepare to report information on their greenhouse gas emissions as soon as 2026. Other states, such as New York and Illinois, may follow California\u2019s lead on climate disclosure.\n\nMore action on \u201cgreenhushing\u201d\n\nIn 2023, the SEC adopted a new rule cracking down on greenwashing and other deceptive or misleading marketing practices by US investment funds. The changes to the two-decade-old SEC Name Rule require that 80% of a fund\u2019s portfolio matches the assets advertised by its name. The regulation targets a boom in funds that have tried to exploit investor interest in ESG investing, with names that do not accurately reflect the fund\u2019s investments or strategies.\n\nShould a new SEC take on more of an anti-ESG sentiment, such as that seen in some Republican-led US states, experts suggest there could be more investigations into funds that seek to downplay their ESG-related investments \u2014 what is often referred to as greenhushing \u2014 in an effort to avoid riling anti-ESG politicians or lawmakers.\n\nThis might be particularly difficult for fund managers operating in both the EU and the US, notes George Raine of Ropes & Gray. \u201cIf you\u2019re a manager who is managing the same strategy, say, in Europe, and you\u2019re out there saying, \u2018Hey, this is an ESG strategy,\u2019 and you fail to mention that in your US version of the same strategy, you would then potentially be violating a rule that says you must go out and say you are an ESG impact fund or an ESG-focused fund,\u201d Raine explains.\n\nUS corporations will continue ESG efforts\n\nDespite the gloomy prognostications at the federal level, some experts said they believe that many US companies will continue pursuing ESG policies and strategies \u2014 if for no other reason than they see it as a good, long-term business practice.\n\n\u201cCompanies committed to sustainability will stay the course because it makes business sense,\u201d said Tim Mohin, global sustainability leader at consulting firm BCG. \u201cInvestors will seek value by avoiding risks and betting on new, efficient green tech. Climate advocates will redouble their work, and the public will increasingly expect action from their elected representatives as climate risks mount.\u201d\n\nMohin says that while US leadership of climate and sustainability action will undoubtedly reverse, \u201cthe future of the global sustainability movement will continue.\u201d"

            "article_text": "In early 2020, Bernard Looney had one clear goal as the incoming chief executive of BP: to convince the world to see the oil company differently. For a time, he did exactly that.\n\nIn a glossy, high-concept London campaign launch, the BP boss set out 10 new aims for the company, the most significant being BP\u2019s transformation to a net zero energy company by 2050.\n\nWithin months, he reinforced the rebranding with a pledge to cut the company\u2019s oil and gas production by 40% from 2019 levels by the end of the decade.\n\nAt the time, his strategy even won the approval of Greenpeace \u2013 a feat few oil executives can boast. But by early 2023, BP had watered down the 40% cut to a 25% reduction after the war in Ukraine caused oil prices to surge, doubling the company\u2019s profits. Within months, its greenest ever chief executive was ousted from the company amid revelations about undisclosed relationships with colleagues. His green plans have followed suit.\n\nIt emerged last week that BP plans to abandon its curbs on fossil fuel production in favour of targeting several new investments in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe news angered climate campaigners, but surprised very few. BP\u2019s green retreat has arguably been the most brazen in the industry \u2013 from a grandstanding green agenda to a fresh focus on fossil fuels \u2013 but the backtrack from environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards is gaining pace among the world\u2019s biggest companies and investors.\n\nThe term ESG was first coined by the UN in a 2004 report entitled Who Cares Wins. It provided companies and investors with a model for implementing the ideals of responsible investing in their spending plans.\n\nView image in fullscreen Former BP chief executive Bernard Looney outlines the company\u2019s new net zero goals in 2020. Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBy 2015, the idea of ESG had evolved from being a talking point to a set of standards which could, and should, be measured. But in recent years, companies and investors in the US and Europe have begun to chafe at the requirements to disclose their ESG credentials, and retreated from the commitments themselves \u2013 often to protect their profits.\n\nBP\u2019s oil industry rival Shell signalled earlier this year that it may slow the pace of its emissions reductions for this decade by setting a new plan to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade, compared with its previous target of 20%.\n\nShell has also backed away from a pledge to rapidly increase its use of \u201cadvanced recycling\u201d, which involves breaking down plastic polymers into tiny molecules that can be made into synthetic fuels or new plastics. It promised to use 1m tonnes of this recycled plastic in its global petrochemicals plants, but later admitted the plan was \u201cunfeasible\u201d.\n\nOil companies are not alone in scaling down their green promises. Volkswagen has quietly dropped a voluntary target to cut CO2\u2082 emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 30% between 2015 and 2025 in favour of making the same cuts between 2018 and 2030.\n\nAnd Unilever \u2013 the conglomerate that owns brands including Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Vaseline, and which is widely credited with pioneering the ESG movement \u2013 signalled earlier this year that it would abandon or water down a string of ESG pledges amid a growing backlash from investors and politicians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very concerning trend,\u201d said Lewis Johnston, director of policy at the responsible investment organisation ShareAction. \u201cIn general, we have seen quite a concerted and organised pushback against some of the principles of responsible investment. It\u2019s a very different philosophy of what generates long-term value.\u201d\n\nAs recently as 2021, the world\u2019s biggest investors counted ESG principles as important hallmarks of a sound investment. The US investment giants BlackRock and Vanguard voted in favour of almost half of all shareholder ESG resolutions proposed in 2021. But since then they have dramatically withdrawn their support following a fierce political backlash.\n\nFlorida governor Ron DeSantis, legislators in Texas and other critics of ESG escalated the stakes in late 2022 by collectively pulling billions of dollars in state funds from BlackRock.\n\nView image in fullscreen Volkswagen has modified a target to reduce carbon emissions. Photograph: Jens Schlueter/Getty Images\n\nThe investment group\u2019s support for ESG measures has since plummeted. BlackRock has confirmed that in the 12 months to the end of June 2024, it supported only 20 of the 493 environmental and social proposals put forward by shareholders at the annual meetings of the firms in which it invests. This represents just 4% of ESG proposals, compared with 47% three years ago.\n\nVanguard supported none of the 400 environmental or social shareholder proposals that it considered in the 2024 US proxy shareholder season, saying they were \u201coverly prescriptive\u201d, unnecessary or did not relate to material financial risks.\n\nGemma Woodward, the head of responsible investment at the UK wealth management firm Quilter Cheviot, highlighted the energy crisis triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as a tipping point in the trend against ESG.\n\n\u201cWe saw a real turn in the market where value came back into fashion, and so we saw an \u2018easing of the pedal\u2019 of the interest in [ESG],\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very worried, obviously \u2026 I guess the problem we\u2019ve got is that we don\u2019t have a global standard.\u201d\n\nHowever, BP and Shell still looked \u201cpretty good\u201d compared with oil companies in the US, where there was an even bigger backlash against ESG, Woodward said. US banks JP Morgan and State Street pulled out of the Climate Action 100+ investor group, which pushes for change from big greenhouse gas emitters, this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly at its most extreme in the US,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not immune to it in the UK or in Europe.\u201d\n\nLast summer, the EU confirmed plans to water down the final rules for corporate ESG disclosures through the European Sustainability Reporting Standards. The move comes after European Commission\u2019s president, Ursula von der Leyen, pledged to cut red tape across the EU executive\u2019s work to counter complaints from big companies over the mounting cost of environmental rules.\n\nUnder the new rules, companies will have more flexibility to decide what information is \u201cmaterial\u201d and therefore should be reported, in effect making some disclosures voluntary instead of mandatory. The easing was described by HSBC analysts at the time as a \u201cstep back\u201d in ambition and robustness, but a step that may facilitate convergence in sustainability reporting globally.\n\nJohnston insisted that climate transition reporting should not be considered yet as another raft of burdensome reporting rules. Instead, he said, it was about making sure companies were aware of both the risks and the opportunities involved in adapting to the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cMandatory [climate] transition plans are a means of empowering companies and positioning the financial system as a whole, and aligning that and the real economy with the transition that we know is coming,\u201d Johnston said.\n\n\u201cSo I think it\u2019s absolutely wrong to look at this as merely another regulatory burden, because it really isn\u2019t \u2026 It\u2019s about imposing discipline and making sure that companies are preparing for what they should be doing, and that\u2019s, again, responsible stewardship.\u201d"

Around three-quarters of companies preparing to file under the directive, including those headquartered outside the EU, say they are factoring sustainability into decision-making to a greater extent, or that they plan to do so. Companies also see multiple business benefits flowing from the CSRD, including better environmental performance, improved engagement with stakeholders and risk mitigation.\n\nThese findings from PwC\u2019s inaugural Global CSRD Survey will encourage supporters of the new reporting regime who argued that greater transparency in sustainability would drive changes in business conduct. At the same time, however, companies say they are facing multiple obstacles to CSRD implementation, including data availability, staff capacity and the need for new investments in technology.\n\nThe CSRD, underpinned by 12 European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), requires companies to make detailed disclosures about sustainability performance and to consider the implications of sustainability for their business across a wide range of topics, including climate change, business conduct, resource use, pollution and biodiversity. About 50,000 companies globally will be affected. (See \u2018About the CSRD,\u2019 below, for more detail.)\n\nAs we\u2019ve argued elsewhere, the directive is not only a major new reporting obligation but also an opportunity for leaders to understand in greater depth how sustainability will challenge today\u2019s business models and create opportunities for growth and reinvention. The survey suggests that companies are starting to appreciate this upside potential. In addition to the indirect benefits noted above, about one-third of survey participants expect CSRD implementation to lead directly to revenue growth and cost savings. Significantly, those further along in their implementation journey are more optimistic about the business benefits across all dimensions (see chart)."

Neither future distribution of this material nor the continued availability of this material in archive form on our website should be deemed to constitute an update or re-affirmation of these figures or statements as of any future date. Any future update will be provided only through a public disclosure indicating that fact.\n\nABOUT THE ADVANCING CLIMATE SOLUTIONS AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORTS\n\nThe Advancing Climate Solutions Report contains terms used by the TCFD, as well as information about how the disclosures in this report are consistent with the recommendations of the TCFD. In doing so, ExxonMobil is not obligating itself to use any terms in the way defined by the TCFD or any other party, nor is it obligating itself to comply with any specific recommendation of the TCFD or to provide any specific disclosure. For example, with respect to the term \u201cmaterial,\u201d individual companies are best suited to determine what information is material, under the long-standing U.S. Supreme Court definition, and whether to include this information in U.S. Securities and Exchange Act filings. In addition, the ISSB is evaluating standards that provide their interpretation of TCFD which may or may not be consistent with the current TCFD recommendations.\n\nThese publications have been prepared at shareholders\u2019 request or for their convenience and intentionally focused on unknown future events that we have been asked to consider. Forward-looking and other statements regarding environmental and other sustainability efforts and aspirations are not intended to communicate any material investment information under the laws of the United States or represent that these are required disclosures. These publications are not intended to imply that ExxonMobil has access to any significant non-public insights on future events that the reader could not independently research. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking environmental and other sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future, including future laws and rulemaking. Forward-looking and other statements regarding environmental and other sustainability efforts and aspirations are for informational purposes only and are not intended as an advertisement for ExxonMobil\u2019s equity, debt, businesses, products, or services and the reader is specifically notified that any investor-requested disclosure or future required disclosure is not and should not be construed as an inducement for the reader to purchase any product or services. The statements and analysis in these publications represent a good faith effort by the Company to address these investor requests despite significant unknown variables and, at times, inconsistent market data, government policy signals, and calculation, methodologies, or reporting standards.\n\nActions needed to advance ExxonMobil\u2019s 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on the Company\u2019s Global Outlook research and publication. The Global Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. However, the Global Outlook does not attempt to project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the GIobal Outlook, and the Company\u2019s business plans will be updated as appropriate. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect investment decisions made by the corporation or its affiliates. Individual projects or opportunities may advance based on a number of factors, including availability of supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emission investments is based on our corporate plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set, public policy support, other factors, and focused on returns.\n\nEnergy demand modeling aims to replicate system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring simplifications. The reference to any scenario or any pathway for an energy transition, including any potential net-zero scenario, does not imply ExxonMobil views any particular scenario as likely to occur. In addition, energy demand scenarios require assumptions on a variety of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty. For example, the IEA describes its NZE scenario as extremely challenging, requiring unprecedented innovation, unprecedented international cooperation, and sustained support and participation from consumers, with steeper reductions required each year since the scenario\u2019s initial release. Third-party scenarios discussed in these reports reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use or inclusion herein is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their underlying assumptions, likelihood, or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of ExxonMobil\u2019s separate planning process but may be secondarily tested for robustness or resiliency against different assumptions, including against various scenarios. These reports contain information from third parties. ExxonMobil makes no representation or warranty as to the third-party information. Where necessary, ExxonMobil received permission to cite third-party sources, but the information and data remain under the control and direction of the third parties. ExxonMobil has also provided links in this report to third-party websites for ease of reference. ExxonMobil\u2019s use of the third-party content is not an endorsement or adoption of such information.\n\nExxonMobil reported emissions, including reductions and avoidance performance data, are based on a combination of measured and estimated data. We assess our performance to support continuous improvement throughout the organization using our Environmental Performance Indicator (EPI) process. The reporting guidelines and indicators in the Ipieca, the American Petroleum Institute (API), the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers Sustainability Reporting Guidance for the Oil and Gas Industry (4th edition, 2020, revised February 2023) and key chapters of the GHG Protocol inform the EPI process and the selection of the data reported. Emissions reported are estimates only, and performance data depends on variations in processes and operations, the availability of sufficient data, the quality of those data and methodology used for measurement and estimation. Emissions data is subject to change as methods, data quality, and technology improvements occur, and changes to performance data may be updated. Emissions, reductions, abatements and enabled avoidance estimates for non-ExxonMobil operated facilities are included in the equity data and similarly may be updated as changes in the performance data are reported. ExxonMobil\u2019s plans to reduce emissions are good-faith efforts based on current relevant data and methodology, which could be changed or refined. ExxonMobil works to continuously improve its approach to identifying, measuring, and addressing emissions. ExxonMobil actively engages with industry, including API and Ipieca, to improve emission factors and methodologies, including measurements and estimates.\n\nAny reference to ExxonMobil\u2019s support of, work with, or collaboration with a third-party organization within these publications do not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization. ExxonMobil participates, along with other companies, institutes, universities and other organizations, in various initiatives, campaigns, projects, groups, trade organizations, and other collaborations among industry and through organizations like the United Nations that express various ambitions, aspirations and goals related to climate change, emissions, sustainability, and the energy transition. ExxonMobil\u2019s participation or membership in such collaborations is not a promise or guarantee that ExxonMobil\u2019s individual ambitions, future performance or policies will align with the collective ambitions of the organizations or the individual ambitions of other participants, all of which are subject to a variety of uncertainties and other factors, many of which may be beyond ExxonMobil\u2019s control, including government regulation, availability and cost-effectiveness of technologies, and market forces and other risks and uncertainties. Such third parties\u2019 statements of collaborative or individual ambitions and goals frequently diverge from ExxonMobil\u2019s own ambitions, plans, goals, and commitments. ExxonMobil will continue to make independent decisions regarding the operation of its business, including its climate-related and sustainability-related ambitions, plans, goals, commitments, and investments. ExxonMobil\u2019s future ambitions, goals and commitments reflect ExxonMobil\u2019s current plans, and ExxonMobil may unilaterally change them for various reasons, including adoption of new reporting standards or practices, market conditions; changes in its portfolio; and financial, operational, regulatory, reputational, legal and other factors.\n\nReferences to \u201cresources,\u201d \u201cresource base,\u201d \u201crecoverable resources\u201d and similar terms refer to the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. The resource base includes quantities of oil and natural gas classified as proved reserves, as well as quantities that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. The term \u201cresource base\u201d is not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as \u201cprobable\u201d or \u201cpossible\u201d reserves.

The term \u201cproject\u201d as used in these publications can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation has numerous affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil, Exxon, Mobil, Esso, and XTO. For convenience and simplicity, those terms and terms such as \u201cCorporation,\u201d \u201ccompany,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d and \u201cits\u201d are sometimes used as abbreviated references to one or more specific affiliates or affiliate groups. Abbreviated references describing global or regional operational organizations, and global or regional business lines are also sometimes used for convenience and simplicity. Nothing contained herein is intended to override the corporate separateness of affiliated companies. Exxon Mobil Corporation\u2019s goals do not guarantee any action or future performance by its affiliates or Exxon Mobil Corporation\u2019s responsibility for those affiliates\u2019 actions and future performance, each affiliate of which manages its own affairs. For convenience and simplicity, words like venture, joint venture, partnership, co-venturer and partner are used to indicate business relationships involving common activities and interests, and those words may not indicate precise legal relationships. These publications cover Exxon Mobil Corporation\u2019s owned and operated businesses and do not address the performance or operations of our suppliers, contractors or partners unless otherwise noted. In the case of certain joint ventures for which ExxonMobil is the operator, we often exercise influence but not control. Thus, the governance, processes, management and strategy of these joint ventures may differ from those in these reports. At the time of publication, ExxonMobil has completed the acquisition of Denbury Inc. and is in the process of acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources. These reports do not speak of these companies\u2019 historic governance, risk management, strategy approaches or emissions performance unless specifically referenced.\n\nThese reports or any material therein is not to be used or reproduced without the permission of Exxon Mobil Corporation. All rights reserved.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FOR NON-GAAP AND OTHER MEASURES\n\nThe Resiliency section of the Advancing Climate Solutions Report mentions modeled operating cash flow in comparing different businesses over time in a future scenario. Historic operating cash flow is defined as net income, plus depreciation, depletion and amortization for consolidated and equity companies, plus noncash adjustments related to asset retirement obligations plus proceeds from asset sales. The Company\u2019s long-term portfolio modeling estimates operating cash flow as revenue or margins less cash expenses, taxes and abandonment expenditures plus proceeds from asset sales before portfolio capital expenditures. The Company believes this measure can be helpful in assessing the resiliency of the business to generate cash from different potential future markets. The performance data presented in the Advancing Climate Solutions Report and Sustainability Report, including on emissions, is not financial data and is not GAAP data."

It also aims to achieve a better understanding of the potential influence of climate litigation on the creditworthiness of issuers and when such exposure might translate into a material financial impact.\n\nWe examined a range of climate-related lawsuits (or cases), mostly from the oil and gas sector, which has been the subject of many such cases, as well as information from the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law's databases. To consider how climate litigation risk may potentially affect entities, this research explores a possible approach for categorizing the related direct and indirect costs, taking into account the uncertainties inherent to litigation risk.\n\nClimate Litigation Has Not Been Universally Defined\n\nIn our view, climate litigation typically refers to legal actions taken by a variety of stakeholders, including individuals, organizations, governments and other entities seeking redress for climate change-related issues. However, what is considered and tracked as climate-related litigation is quite broad and covers a wide spectrum of topics, including environmental damage, climate-related human rights issues, and misrepresentation of environmental credentials.\n\nThe legal grounds for climate litigation are distinct to the substantive and procedural laws of the jurisdiction in which the lawsuits are filed. The causes of climate-related lawsuits typically involve allegations that the parties being sued have \u2014 by act or omission \u2014 exacerbated climate change, failed to mitigate or effectively adapt to the effects of climate change, or lack adequate transparency in their climate-related disclosures.\n\nThere is no international court-sponsored registry of climate-related lawsuits or a universally agreed definition of what constitutes climate-related litigation. For the purposes of this research, we therefore look to legal scholars who have used their judgement in labeling a particular case as part of the overall body of climate litigation. We used data from Columbia\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, which appears to provide the most comprehensive collection of climate-related cases to date.\n\nThe overall availability and consistency of data are still lacking. This is even with the work being done by a handful of academic centers globally to collect and categorize climate-related cases.\n\nClimate litigation tends to be in six broad categories, according to a 2023 report by the UN Environment Program and the Sabin Center. These categories are cases linked to human rights as part of national and international laws; domestic nonenforcement of climate-related laws and policies; the extraction of fossil fuels; the extent and quality of climate disclosures; corporate liability and responsibility for climate damage; and failure to adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n\nClimate-Related Lawsuits Have Spiked Since 2013\n\nDue to disparate definitions, jurisdictional nuances and other hurdles, discerning the exact number of climate-related cases in any given sector remains a challenge. What is clear, however, is that as the physical impacts of climate change become more visible and global debates over decarbonization intensify, various stakeholders are increasingly turning to the courts to address associated issues. These stakeholders include states, nongovernmental organizations, investors and communities.\n\nThe cumulative number of climate-related cases launched has more than quadrupled over the past 10 years to 2,410 in 2023 from 581 in 2013 (see chart 1). We believe that this reflects societal pressure and increasing awareness of the impacts of climate change as data and information on physical climate risks and transition risks become more available and accessible worldwide.\n\nThe number of new climate-related cases filed annually seems to be slowing, after peaking at 263 in 2021. The following year, 254 new cases were filed, and in 2023, the number of lawsuit filings dropped to 200 (see chart 2). Nevertheless, we believe that the annual volume of newly initiated climate-related cases will likely remain much higher than in 2015, the year 196 countries adopted the Paris Agreement on climate change. We will continue to monitor the emergence and pace of new cases since this information will contribute to a better understanding of the impact of climate litigation on companies and governments over time.\n\nClimate Litigation Has Spread Across Countries And Sectors\n\nAs the number of climate-related lawsuits have increased, so too have the geographic locations, sectors and subjects of litigation. Jurisdictions range from developed countries, where plaintiffs may be seeking compensation for climate-related damage, to developing nations grappling with the disproportionate impacts of climate change.\n\nMore jurisdictions apart from the US are seeing climate-related cases\n\nThe US represents nearly 70% of all cases found in the Sabin Center\u2019s climate litigation tracking databases. However, the number of jurisdictions where lawsuits have been filed has increased rapidly, to 75 in 2023 from 24 in 2017 (see Tigre and Barry, 2023).\n\nThese include cases launched in the courts of 54 sovereigns plus those launched in 21 international or regional courts, tribunals, quasi-judicial bodies or other adjudicatory bodies, including special procedures of the United Nations and arbitration tribunals. In particular, climate-related lawsuits were filed in new jurisdictions, such as in Panama and Portugal, in 2023, while several new cases have been filed in emerging markets such as Brazil and T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nMost climate litigation is in the oil and gas sector, but similar lawsuits are being filed in other sectors as well\n\nOil and gas companies have historically been subject to the majority of climate-related lawsuits. However, such lawsuits are also increasingly being filed against companies in other sectors, including financial institutions. In our view, the increasing diversification of climate-related litigation across sectors reflects the rising awareness of various industries' exposure to the physical and transition risks associated with climate change.\n\nAs the legal landscape evolves, it is likely that additional sectors will become subject to climate-related lawsuits. Oil and gas companies remain a key focus of climate-related litigation, but the range of sectors involved has been slowly widening since 2021. Research from Setzer and Higham (2023) shows an extension of such litigation to include most sectors, but in particular travel, food and tobacco manufacturing, financial, chemicals, and utilities. One of the reasons for this diversification is the increase in cases focused on the alleged misrepresentation of environmental credentials by entities. For instance, in 2023, environmental groups filed the first climate-related lawsuit against a commercial bank, BNP Paribas, for its continued financing of fossil fuels. And in January 2024, Friends of the Earth Netherlands (Milieudefensie) announced it was initiating a climate-related lawsuit against ING Group on similar grounds.\n\nThe scope has also shifted to include \"climate accountability\"\n\nWe see a trend of so-called climate-accountability lawsuits in the US, where mainly oil and gas companies are sued for their alleged role in climate-related damage and deception. In September 2023, the state of California filed a case against five oil majors, claiming those companies had deceived the public by downplaying risks posed by fossil fuels and causing billions of dollars in damage (see State of California v. Exxon Mobil Corp et. al, 2023). The 2023 case against oil and gas majors has not yet gone to trial, and there are uncertainties about several factors, including the final outcome. This lawsuit has so far not had an impact on our credit ratings for the companies being sued.\n\nA favorable ruling for plaintiffs in climate-accountability lawsuits in the US could lead to similar lawsuits in the future. These could be filed in other US states or in countries facing the costly impact of climate change-related damage (see \"Lost GDP: Potential Impacts Of Physical Climate Risks,\" published Nov. 27, 2023). Even if the courts do not rule in the state of California's favor, that is unlikely to be the end of similar lawsuits being brought against oil producers.\n\nCompanies are not the only ones being sued, and the legal basis is widening\n\nThe defendants in climate-related litigation are not only companies but also their boards, and legal claims are sometimes supported by non-climate-related legislation.\n\nCompany directors have also been subject to climate-related lawsuits. In a landmark case, the not-for-profit organization ClientEarth filed a derivative action against Shell's board of directors in 2023 for alleged breach of fiduciary duty related to climate change risk management (see ClientEarth, 2023). In this instance, the case was dismissed. However, similar cases have been successful, such as the lawsuit filed by PG&E Victims Trust against PG&E's executives and board members in connection with wildfires in California in 2017 and 2018. This lawsuit resulted in a $117 million settlement (see PG&E Fire Victim Trust v. PG&E, 2021).\n\nOil and gas companies have instigated climate-related lawsuits of their own. For example, in January 2024, Exxon Mobil Corp. sued shareholders that made a proposal calling for the company to speed up the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (also referred to as \"emissions\") and to set Scope 3 emissions targets. The shareholder proposal has since been withdrawn. In Italy, ENI SpA filed a lawsuit against Greenpeace in July 2023 after the group, along with other parties, filed a civil suit in May that year against the oil company for its contribution to climate change.\n\nIn the US, oil and gas companies are also being sued under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act as part of climate-related litigation. The use of the RICO Act demonstrates a new legal tactic that plaintiffs are using to try to make oil and gas companies accountable for climate-related damage. Two separate lawsuits were filed against Exxon Mobil Corp. and others in 2020 and 2022 alleging violation of the RICO Act (see Municipalities of Puerto Rico v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 2022 and City of Hoboken v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 2020). If the courts find in favor of the plaintiffs, this could set a precedent for future claims linked to economic losses from extreme weather events or natural disasters. Neither lawsuit has had an impact on the credit ratings for the companies named as defendants to date; the cases are ongoing.\n\nMeasuring The Strategic And Financial Impacts Of Climate Litigation Remains Complex\n\nWe believe that climate litigation will remain a key trend for the coming years since some stakeholders are increasingly pushing companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and governments globally have been enacting stricter climate-related policies and regulations.\n\nTo date, it has been difficult to discern the potential impacts of climate litigation on corporations, particularly because many cases are pending. Nevertheless, climate litigation cases could provide information that contributes to an assessment of the credibility of the companies\u2019 climate claims.\n\nWe see increased public awareness and climate litigation risks as two key factors that can lead to financial impacts for most entities in a sector. Although a climate-related issue may not be material now, legal actions can suddenly result in a financial impact (see \u201cMateriality Mapping: Providing Insights Into The Relative Materiality Of ESG Factors,\u201d published May 18, 2022). For the oil and gas industry, for example, we see climate transition risks as the most material exposure from both a stakeholder and credit standpoint (see \u201cESG Materiality Map: Oil And Gas,\u201d published May 18, 2022).\n\nThe uncertainty of legal outcomes limits impact assessments\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles in translating climate litigation risk into financial impacts is the high degree of uncertainty about when a case will end and what the final ruling will be. Legal outcomes are highly variable and depend on factors such as jurisdiction, the nature of the claims, the strength of legal arguments, and the willingness of parties to settle or appeal.\n\nThe variability of outcomes extends to the magnitude of penalties and to timing. One unfavorable ruling for a defendant could far outweigh the perceived (and actual) benefits of multiple favorable rulings for all defendants. Moreover, the issue of timing is material beyond the timing of a final ruling. It extends to the timing of payment associated with any penalty. For example, a company may be able to absorb a large penalty without a material deterioration of its financial metrics if the company in question has large amounts of existing capital and ongoing free cash flow or if that penalty is spread across a number of years.\n\nConsequently, litigation risk of any type, including related to climate change, must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In so doing, one must take into account the inherent uncertainty about legal rulings, their timing, and any associated costs in the context of the business and financial risk profiles of a company subject to a lawsuit. Nevertheless, from a credit perspective, even if financial impacts are not immediately quantifiable, other components of our credit rating assessment may capture litigation risk, such as our management and governance analysis or our comparable ratings analysis.\n\nClimate litigation costs could be both direct and indirect\n\nOne can discern two types of costs associated with litigation: direct and indirect, as posited in the 2020 Green Finance paper \"Climate Change Litigation as a Financial Risk\" (see Solana, 2020). To consider how climate litigation risk may potentially affect entities, this research explores a possible approach to categorize direct and indirect costs, drawing on Solana 2020:\n\nDirect costs stem from payment of legal fees, penalties, settlements, and any other outlay of cash for the purpose of pursuing or defending against litigation.\n\nIndirect costs include opportunity costs, for example associated with the cash an issuer keeps on its balance sheet to hedge against the financial impact of an unfavorable ruling or the amount of time that management spends on preparing for trials, as well as intangible costs, such as the impact on a business' reputation from being named a defendant in climate-related lawsuit.\n\nThe distinction between direct and indirect costs is often unclear since it depends on the specifics of a company's business and the sector in which it operates (see the case study below).\n\nCase study: Direct and indirect costs from climate litigation In the case of Milieudefensie v. Royal Dutch Shell, a Dutch court ruled in 2021 that Shell had to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% relative to 2019 levels (see Milieudefensie, 2021). The allocation of Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions in that 45% is flexible. However, a certain amount must come from Scope 3, which accounts for nearly all of oil and gas companies\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions. Shell has appealed the ruling, but while that is pending, the company must comply with the court's decision until a higher court overrules it. If the ruling is confirmed, it would have an impact on Shell\u2019s oil and gas operations, which would need to be reduced. It could also affect Shell's value chain because legacy suppliers could face greater competition from suppliers with offerings that are less emissions-intensive; that said, purchased goods and services represent a small share of oil and gas companies' Scope 3 emissions. The ruling could also influence Shell\u2019s expansion decisions by making certain fossil fuel projects less attractive. The appeal proceedings started in April 2024, but the company had already announced in March 2024 that it was reducing its near-term emissions cuts. Nevertheless, legally mandated decarbonization may change the way stakeholders are positioned across the value chain and how they interact with the company.\n\nThere is insufficient data to use as a yardstick for direct costs\n\nThere is relatively little publicly available data on specific costs that have been incurred, defended or settled as a result of climate-related cases. This is mainly because these numbers have not been made public by plaintiffs or defendants. In addition, many court decisions that include quantified monetary penalties are still under appeal, implying that the penalty could increase, decrease or be removed.\n\nOne possible way to estimate the direct costs of litigation is to look at companies\u2019 own reporting. Many companies now list climate change, or a similar factor, as a risk in their annual reports. However, we are not aware of companies in the oil and gas sector that disclose financial reserves earmarked specifically for climate litigation. Also, we do not know of companies in that sector that highlight climate litigation, in particular, when discussing litigation as a risk factor in their financial statements. With International Accounting Standards requiring the recognition of provisions where future cash flows are regarded as \"probable\" or \"more likely than not,\" most climate-related risks do not result in an accrued expense on the balance sheet. This implies that the financial impacts of physical climate risks and climate transition risks, due to the unpredictability of their timing and amount, would not be recognized on companies' balance sheets. Indeed, a significant number of entities conclude that these future cash flows are only a remote possibility, and we observe that the majority of issuers do not disclose climate risk-related contingent liabilities. Under current international accounting rules, a company can keep off its balance sheet a liability that could, in theory, be large enough \u2014 if it crystallized \u2014 to significantly impair its reported financial position. This is typical for provisions: liabilities of uncertain size and likelihood. This includes liabilities associated with climate litigation (see \u201cReimagining Accounting To Measure Climate Change Risks,\u201d published Dec. 4, 2020).\n\nClimate-related lawsuits have not yet resulted in massive monetary settlements like those seen in sectors such as tobacco. In the past, litigation costs and liability risks associated with the harm caused by asbestos led to the bankruptcy of dozens of affected companies (see Carrington, 2007). Equally, the direct costs of lawsuits against tobacco companies or opioid-related cases in the US took several years to transpire but had material financial and strategic impacts on many of the companies sued. We believe that generally, oil and gas companies subject to climate-related lawsuits are able to absorb the financial consequences of a ruling against them without a material negative impact on their credit profiles. However, if many companies in the sector were hit with financial litigation-related penalties, the implications could be more material for the sector, overall.\n\nIndirect costs are difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy\n\nA recent study by the London School of Economics found a causal link between climate litigation and the stock price of carbon-intensive companies, suggesting that an unfavorable legal outcome reduces the share price of such companies by an average of 1.5%. This could imply that market participants are recognizing and pricing the reputational risk of climate litigation against such companies (see Sato et al. 2023). However, such a mild decline in share price would generally have no, or limited, bearing on our assessment of a company's creditworthiness. An estimate of the true extent of indirect costs may therefore be possible only through qualitative analysis.\n\nReputational risk related to climate litigation can translate into a cost, but several factors may influence the magnitude of that cost. Threats to a company's reputation can come from many sources, both internal and external, and can be unpredictable. Relatively low indirect costs of climate-related reputational risk in the past do not imply the same for the future. In the context of this research, we find that there could be six main factors that, although they typically evolve over time, could affect the magnitude of reputational risk and the associated indirect costs. The use of social media and the internet may also have an impact on this list of factors, which is not exhaustive:\n\nCustomer awareness. Are customers sufficiently aware of the company's brand and the legal action against it?\n\nAre customers sufficiently aware of the company's brand and the legal action against it? Availability of substitutes. Are there substitutes of, or alternatives to, the products or services, and if so, are they feasible options for customers?\n\nAre there substitutes of, or alternatives to, the products or services, and if so, are they feasible options for customers? Customer behavior. What portion of the customer base will stop buying or reduce purchases, assuming they are aware of the climate litigation and can do so?\n\nWhat portion of the customer base will stop buying or reduce purchases, assuming they are aware of the climate litigation and can do so? Stability of financing.

Investor relations. Will investors want to commit to projects, divest shares, exclude the issuer from certain funds, or use hedging tools to cover losses?\n\nWill investors want to commit to projects, divest shares, exclude the issuer from certain funds, or use hedging tools to cover losses? Human capital. Will current and prospective employees be likely to consider alternative employment as a result of perceived reputational damage?\n\nRulings can also have implications for the value chain and other stakeholders\n\nThese impacts typically result from climate litigation in which a company is not a party. For example, in the case of Held v. the State of Montana (2023), the first state constitutional climate change lawsuit to go to trial in the US, the court ruled as unconstitutional a provision in the Montana Environmental Policy Act that prohibited the state from considering greenhouse gas emissions when deciding whether to issue permits for energy-related projects. The court held that the provision in the act violated the right to a safe environment as established in Montana\u2019s constitution; Montana appealed the ruling in October 2023, and a decision is pending.\n\nThe defendants in the case were not corporations, and none of the large emitters of greenhouse gases were required to pay a fine. However, the ruling allows the state to factor greenhouse gas emissions into its decision on permits in the future, which may create an environment in which it is costlier for fossil-fuel projects to compete with renewable energy projects in the state.\n\nThe surge in climate-related cases has not affected credit quality so far\n\nThe majority of climate-related lawsuits filed to date have been against companies in the hydrocarbons sector, mainly the oil and gas majors. However, to date, climate-related litigation has not had a discernable impact on the ratings of oil and gas companies rated by S&P Global Ratings.\n\nNonetheless, climate transition risk and other climate-related factors are incorporated into our industry risk assessment of the oil and gas sector. Moreover, we note that some companies are becoming increasingly focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions within their core operations, with many also developing lower-carbon business segments.\n\nInsurers Are Reviewing Their Exposure To Climate Litigation\n\nUltimately, an important question would be: If a financially significant court ruling were handed down, who would pay it?\n\nThe amount and type of insurance coverage purchased by a company named as a defendant in a climate-related lawsuit could play an important role in that company's ability to absorb the associated costs. Regardless of the outcome of these cases, we believe that insurers have identified climate litigation as a key risk and are reviewing the wording of insurance policies to include more specific language regarding whether climate-related cases are covered and in what circumstances. In addition, insurance coverage for climate litigation may become more difficult to contract as the number and severity of such lawsuits increase.\n\nFor now, we observe that insurers' existing products that are covering claims from climate litigation have seen rather low claims severity. As the legal landscape evolves, new litigation strategies emerge, and the scope of climate litigation broadens, it should become clearer how claims severity trends could develop in the future. This said, we believe that insurers offering products that cover climate litigation are closely monitoring the establishment of legal practices in this area. It remains to be seen how the insurance sector will respond if legal precedents are set in future climate-related lawsuits.\n\nLarge companies typically have various insurance policies, which could at least partly provide a hedge against costs related to climate litigation. These types of insurance policies are mainly those covering liability relating to a company's directors and officers (D&O), commercial general business, products, or the environment. Such policies tend to be provided by the world\u2019s largest insurers and, as such, those insurers would likely not face difficulty in paying claims. In addition, insurance policies tend to contain exclusion clauses.\n\nHowever, interpretation by courts of whether claims arising from or associated with the emission of greenhouse gases constitute an insurable claim creates uncertainty about whether such policies may cover some of the costs associated with climate-related litigation. This uncertainty is highlighted by a pending case in Hawaii (Aloha Petroleum Ltd. V. National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, 2022). The plaintiff asserts that it incurred more than $880,000 of costs in defending climate-related lawsuits and that it expects to incur significant additional costs as the litigation progresses. The plaintiff has also stated that it expects to be reimbursed and indemnified by its insurer. The defendant, the insurance provider, refused to reimburse the litigation costs, citing a clause in the policy contract that excludes certain pollution-related actions. One of the key questions before the Hawaii Supreme Court is whether greenhouse gases are pollutants, as defined in the policy's exclusion clause. In another court case, Steadfast Insurance Co. v. AES Corp., the insurance company refused to indemnify its policyholder, AES Corp., against a lawsuit seeking climate change-related damages. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed a ruling in favor of the insurance company. The court held that harms arising from greenhouse gas emissions did not represent an \u201caccident\u201d or \u201coccurrence\u201d under the terms of the commercial general liability policy that AES Corp. had purchased since the emissions were alleged to be the \u201cnatural consequence of an intentional act\u201d by AES Corp.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs the physical impacts associated with climate change become more pronounced, we believe that more entities could face a rising number of courtroom challenges because of their strategies, action or inaction on dealing with climate change. Successful or not, such cases may not only serve to raise awareness about the impacts of climate change but could also bring into the spotlight entities with inadequate climate disclosure or operations attributable to climate change.\n\nAmid worsening climate hazards, corporates making insufficient progress on adaptation and not implementing climate transition plans (see \u201cRisky Business: Companies\u2019 Progress On Adapting To Climate Change,\u201d published April 3, 2024) could lead to further litigation cases related to both physical and transition risks.\n\nTo date, climate litigation has not had a material impact on issuers\u2019 creditworthiness; however, we expect climate-related lawsuits may be one of many mechanisms by which transition risk crystalizes for issuers. Such lawsuits carry the risk of damage to a company's reputation and financial profile, which can affect their creditworthiness. We also believe that more cases related to physical risk could be forthcoming. We continue to watch the costs of this type of litigation and monitor the extent to which those costs may challenge an issuer\u2019s creditworthiness.\n\nRelated Research\n\nExternal Research\n\nEditor\n\nBernadette Stroeder\n\nDigital Designer\n\nJoe Carrick-Varty"

Some shareholders of international oil companies (IOCs) have pressed them to pay closer attention to ESG goals and diversify their business models away from hydrocarbons and into other sources of energy amid efforts to address greenhouse gas emissions.[1]\n\nNational oil companies (NOCs)\u2014which currently control about 50 percent of the world\u2019s oil production\u2014have different corporate mandates than their IOC peers that might imply a more complicated relationship with ESG goals. NOCs are mainly owned by governments in the developing world, and thus face vastly different demands than IOCs answering to private sector shareholders.[2] But different does not mean NOCs do not or will not feel pressure to address ESG issues.\n\nGiven NOCs\u2019 significant share of global oil production\u2014and the fact that this share may increase as IOCs diversify\u2014the pressures they face and changes they make could have a significant impact on the future of the oil and gas industry as well as countries\u2019 abilities to meet climate goals. During the November 2021 COP 26 meetings in Glasgow, Saudi Arabia and India became the latest countries with strong NOCs to pledge to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the next decades.[3]\n\nThis commentary examines how the ESG agenda is impacting NOCs through the ecosystem of organizations and principles that have emerged from the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement as well as from investors and regulators in global financial markets.\n\nThe piece then describes the three components of the ESG framework in relation to NOCs and the challenges of accurately measuring adherence to them due to insufficient standardization of metrics and the variety of reporting frameworks. Also, because environmental, social, and governance competence are not strictly related to one another, companies may be strong in some areas and weak in others, making it difficult to evaluate their ESG performance as a whole.[4] Finally, while ESG pressures are coming alongside discussions about the energy transition and climate change, ESG assessments do not evaluate companies\u2019 energy transition plans, even if some aspects of ESG scores might provide insights about them.\n\nThe commentary pays special attention to the importance of corporate governance for national oil companies in achieving overall ESG goals, given the key differences between their ownership structure and that of private sector companies working in the oil industry.\n\nThe ESG Ecosystem and Its Effect on NOCs\n\nSeveral areas of influence are converging to encourage NOCs to take ESG concerns seriously. First, a UN-led ESG ecosystem has emerged since the term ESG was first coined by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative in 2005. It has grown over the years into a complex web of organizations that is putting significant pressure on all actors, including NOCs and their shareholders, to improve their ESG performance.[5] This UN-led ESG ecosystem includes, for example, initiatives like the UN Global Compact, created in 2000 to garner pledges from nonfinancial corporates to uphold 10 principles around environmental responsibility, anticorruption practices, and labor and human rights. At least 16 NOCs are signatories to this compact.[6] Another initiative is the investor-led Principles for Responsible Investment, created in 2005 for asset managers and asset owners pledging to incorporate ESG principles into their investment decisions. Today, the principles are supported by 3,826 financial institutions from 80 countries, with about $120 trillion in assets under management.[7]\n\nBut it was not until a decade later that the ESG agenda received a decisive boost with the Paris Agreement in 2015 and commitments by governments to tackle climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This was followed the same year by the formal adoption by all UN member states of the United Nation\u2019s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to be achieved by 2030. The SDGs refer to principles like climate action, affordable and clean energy, clean water and sanitation, respect for life on land and water, gender equality, peace, justice, and strong institutions. [8]\n\nA second area of ESG influence involves financial institutions that have become signatories of the Principles for Responsible Investment. These investors have been putting pressure on IOCs and are starting to do the same with NOCs. Levers that investors are exercising with IOCs as shareholders might not be as strong and effective with NOCs, given government control over these companies\u2019 boards. However, some of the largest NOCs issue bonds in international markets, and the need to access capital to finance their own capital investments and refinance their debt while also paying oil rents to governments represents a pressure point. Bondholders are starting to expect NOCs to be more ESG-compliant, and because these companies might be considered too big to fail, changes in their access to finance could have dire consequences for their countries.[9] Repercussions for less-compliant NOCs and their shareholder governments are also starting to emerge elsewhere in the financial world, one example being NOC removal from an ESG index.[10] The upshot might be that ESG considerations start to impact capital allocation and even divestment and investment decisions by NOCs.[11]\n\nThird, pressures on the ESG performance of IOCs might in turn impact NOCs, particularly in the context of joint venture partnerships. This is because a focus on IOCs also means attention is being paid to the ESG performance of their non-operated assets. Non-operated assets are those in a joint venture partnership between IOCs with national oil companies in emerging markets in which IOCs are not the asset operators but have an equity position.[12] The International Energy Agency estimates that while IOCs directly own oil production of 10 million barrels per day, their equity stakes in producing fields mean they hold some level of influence over three times that amount.[13]\n\nFourth, some NOCs from emerging markets have listed minority shares in stock markets, including Saudi Aramco; Russia\u2019s Rosneft and Gazprom; Brazil\u2019s Petrobras; China\u2019s Petrochina, Sinopec, and CNOOC; India\u2019s ONGC; and Colombia\u2019s Ecopetrol, among others. Publicly listed NOCs are responsible for about half of the oil produced by NOCs globally, and their combined oil production is approximately that of OPEC\u2019s.\n\nWhen NOCs list their shares in the stock market, they face the same reporting requirements as any other publicly listed company. Moreover, most of the NOCs that have decided to list their minority shares in their domestic stock markets have also done so in foreign markets. This means that heightened regulatory actions around ESG in global financial centers are likely to impact NOC reporting requirements in the same way they do IOCs\u2019.\n\nESG Metrics and Performance: Measuring Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors\n\nESG disclosures and ratings have the potential to drive improvement in ESG performance by identifying the best in class and separating leaders from laggards. But the multitude of disclosure standards and divergence in how companies are graded on their ESG credentials has led to confusion about actual ESG performance.[14] Still, significant effort is being invested in identifying the ESG factors and metrics that are relevant[15] and material for each industry\u2014meaning they can impact a company\u2019s operating or financial performance.[16]\n\nThe relevant environmental metrics for integrated oil and gas companies, which fits with IOCs and the NOCs, by and large concentrate on the following topics: a company\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, how it manages its toxic emissions and waste, water management, and impact on biodiversity and land use in the areas it operates.[17]\n\nOn GHG emissions, reporting involves quantitative metrics related to the carbon intensity of a company\u2019s direct operations and methane emissions (scope 1 and 2 emissions), which are indeed a key focus of the climate change discussion. Pressures are mounting for disclosures on scope 3 emissions, which are generated indirectly across the entire value chain.[18]\n\nBut the environmental component of ESG is also about the current management of environmental risks, such as water management,[19] toxic emissions, and waste management. These are of particular relevance to the oil industry because of the operational risks linked to spills, a release of pollutants, and mismanagement of industrial waste. Any such occurrences can result in large financial liabilities and have a significant impact on the communities where oil companies operate, causing very high reputational costs for IOCs and NOCs alike. On biodiversity and land use, the focus is on where oil and gas companies operate and their impact on the land, the ecosystem, and the wildlife in that area, as well as remedial and recovery actions by companies. This means that oil production near the Artic or rain forests could be more impacted by ESG-related concerns.\n\nThere have been many allegations of greenwashing in relation to environmental performance.[20] Some such criticisms identify the voluntary, unaudited, and self-reporting nature of ESG data.[21] Other possible shortcomings with environmental disclosures relate to the strength of the enforcement of environmental regulations and of regulatory agencies where the oil and gas production takes place,[22] as well as doubts about the accuracy of the data itself.[23]\n\nEnvironmental scores also take into account the carbon intensity of the resource base of the production. While a company\u2019s reduction of carbon intensity over time could be related to its energy transition strategies, the current carbon intensity metric more likely reflects a company\u2019s resource endowment. For example, oil production from the Gulf nations could fare better than Canadian oil sands in some of the environmental metrics because of the inherent lower-carbon intensity of their oil production.[24]\n\nThe social component of the ESG agenda in the case of NOCs is a particularly complex category and less the subject of this commentary. But overall, social responsibility involves a company\u2019s relations with its community as well as its labor management, which includes diversity and inclusion and a company\u2019s health and safety record.[25] One aspect of the social dimension that is particularly relevant for an NOC in its management of environmental risks relates to the health, safety, and environment (HSE) of its workforce, as it reflects the company\u2019s governance and compliance around operational risks. While HSE is part of the social responsibility of a company, it is also an indicator of a company\u2019s corporate governance, a key aspect of the ESG agenda for NOCs.\n\nNOCs and Corporate Governance\n\nDefining best in class from an ESG perspective can be a challenge within the oil and gas sector, with the multitude of players from different continents and their diverse ownership structures. The oil and gas sector comprises publicly listed companies from developed markets (e.g., Exxon, Chevron, Conoco, Total, BP, Shell), listed national oil companies from Europe (e.g., Equinor), national oil companies from emerging markets with listed minority shares in stock markets (e.g., Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, Petrobras, Gazprom, CNPC, Sinopec, ONGC, Ecopetrol, YPF, etc.), and NOCs that remain 100 percent government-owned but that issue debt in global financial markets (e.g., Pemex, Pertamina, Petronas, PDVSA).[26]\n\nSome ESG rating agencies consider governance a foundational category for all industries.[27] But sound governance is essential for state-owned companies\u2014especially national oil companies, given their particular ownership structure and their central role of economic importance in capturing and distributing oil rents.\n\nGovernance failures have become a growing financial material risk for investors.[28] In the context of increasing scrutiny over ESG metrics, the right governance structure is also seen as key to ensuring transparency, compliance, and veracity with the ESG corporate disclosures and metrics being requested by investors, rating agencies, and potentially regulators.[29]\n\nGuidelines on best practices of state-owned companies in the extractive industries have been developed over the years by multilateral institutions, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and think tanks.[30] The ESG reporting and evaluations related to governance that are the most relevant to NOCs include:\n\nBoard governance and ownership control: This category evaluates how a board operates, how it is composed, the nomination process, its independence, its competency, and its capacity to manage risks and adhere to best practices.[31] In the case of NOCs that are publicly listed, ESG ratings also look at practices surrounding rights of minority shareholders. [32]\n\nBusiness ethics: This area involves companies\u2019 oversight and management of business ethics issues such as fraud, executive misconduct, corrupt practices, money laundering, or antitrust violations. This is a key area for NOCs as stated by the National Resource Governance Institute Guidelines and IPIECA, the oil and gas sector organization issuing sustainability guidelines for the sector.[33] While not specifically mentioned, among the issues considered in this category are ethical management of procurement practices.\n\nTax transparency/audit: This subcategory looks at transparency over revenue reporting, and independence and effectiveness of audit and financial reporting practices. According to the Global Reporting Institute, the lack of transparency about payments to governments in the oil and gas sector can contribute to inefficient management of public funds, illicit financial flows, and corruption.[34] The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an NGO, has been issuing guidelines for best practices in reporting on revenues generated by extractive industries like the oil and gas sector. [35]\n\nA focus on these three elements can inform NOCs\u2019 strategies for demonstrating effective governance in an increasingly ESG-centered business environment as well as investors wishing to gauge the quality of governance for a particular NOC.\n\nSilvia Andrade, a master\u2019s candidate in sustainability management at Columbia University and a research assistant at the Center on Global Energy Policy, provided research assistance for this commentary.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Derek Browser, \u201cExxonMobil shareholders hand board seats to activist nominees,\u201d The Financial Times, May 26, 2021, https://www.ft.com/content/da6dec6a-6c58-427f-a012-9c1efb71fddf.\n\n[2] \u00d8ystein Noreng, The Oil Business and the State: National Energy Companies and Government Ownership (Abingdon, Oxon; New York, NY : Routledge, 2022).\n\n[3] Yousef Saba, Saeed Azhar, and Marwa Rashad, \u201cTop Oil Exporter Saudi Arabia Targets Net Zero Emissions By 2060\u201d Reuters, October 24, 2021, https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/saudi-arabia-worlds-biggest-oil-exporter-unveil-green-goals-2021-10-23/https://www.ft.com/content/073563e1-157b-4023-ab37-7487bab83360.\n\n[4] For example, in a study about ESG investing, the OECD finds a low correlation between the E score and the ESG score, which underscores that high-scoring ESG does not mean better management of carbon emissions or risk management with respect to climate change.

            "article_text": "As heat, storms and flooding rack the planet, the investment industry has been poked and prodded in the last decade into reallocating at least a portion of its assets to meet the opportunities and risks of the climate emergency. But recent events and trends are causing the financial centres of London, New York and Toronto to rethink support for climate finance.\n\nEnergy security has become an overriding concern in the last two years as oil and gas prices have shot up, and sustainable finance has faced an increasingly hostile political environment in the United States. A consequence of this pushback came on New Year\u2019s Eve, when global financial behemoths Bank of America and Citigroup left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, one of the investment industry climate coalitions championed by the United Nations.\n\nWhat does this mean for the year ahead? Will financial allocators support the energy transition of the future or capitulate to the demands of the present? Here are seven predictions for the world of sustainable finance in 2025, and its related tool kit of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing.\n\nIn the United States, sustainable investors will face attacks on three fronts\n\nPaul Atkins, Donald Trump\u2019s choice to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is an ESG skeptic with a bent to streamlining securities regulation. While not considered a hard-right ideologue, he will reverse ESG-friendly regulations championed by the Biden SEC.\n\n1. Shareholder rights. One of Atkins\u2019s first targets will be Biden-era SEC guidance that makes it easier for investor activists to present shareholder proposals on environmental and social issues at corporate annual meetings. Expect Atkins to reverse the Biden policies and return to guidelines under Trump\u2019s first administration that allow companies to reject ESG proposals if they don\u2019t substantially affect operations.\n\nExpect the Republican-controlled Congress to also weigh in, proposing legislation that would give corporations broad powers to reject shareholder proposals. That said, it\u2019s not clear whether such a law could pass in the next two years, when the 2026 mid-term elections are expected to turn against the Republicans.\n\n2. Climate disclosure. Atkins will also revoke a Biden-SEC regulation requiring publicly listed companies in the United States to disclose their Scope 1 and 2 (operational and energy) carbon dioxide emissions. The impact of this reversal will be muted, however, as climate disclosure rules take effect in California and in Europe, where about 3,000 U.S. companies operating in Europe will have to comply with climate disclosure rules under its Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\n\n3. ESG fiduciary rights. And expect the Trump administration to reverse a Biden Department of Labor rule expressly permitting pension trustees to consider ESG issues in investment decisions. But the Trump rule will be contested in the courts, as sustainably invested pension funds make a legal case that ESG is fundamentally about improving financial assessment of financial risks and returns.\n\nThe takeaway: The Trump administration\u2019s attack on shareholder rights will discourage investors from exercising their rights to file investor proposals on ESG issues. But on climate disclosure and fiduciary rights, this will create regulatory confusion more than a firm barrier to sustainable investing.\n\nShareholder proposals on ESG issues will drop in number and support\n\nShareholder collaboration on ESG issues will take a hit in 2025. Collaborations like the Climate Action 100+ shareholder network will lose clout, as policy changes and the chill from the Trump administration take hold. In 2024, large U.S. asset manager Franklin Templeton joined other managers Nuveen, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and AllianceBernstein in leaving the network, which coordinates shareholder pressure on corporations on climate issues.\n\nAccording to Morningstar data, the number of ESG resolutions at U.S. companies rose sharply between 2021 and 2024, although overall support was 27% in 2024, down from 37% in 2021. The decline was largely due to lower levels of support from the three largest asset managers: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, together known as the Big Three. There has been some pushback from at least one asset owner \u2013 PGGM \u2013 which has dropped some managers that are not meeting the Dutch pension fund\u2019s expectations for ESG engagement.\n\nThe takeaway: In 2025, look for fewer but better-focused ESG proposals that can command larger support from asset owners and managers.\n\nLong-term ESG-focused investors will stay the course\n\nDespite these negative trends, 50% of long-term ESG-oriented investors \u2013 including asset managers, funds and owners employing sustainable finance strategies \u2013 said they plan to maintain their current level of ESG activity in 2025, while 29% said they plan to increase it moderately and 10% plan a significant expansion, according to a survey by the U.S. Sustainable Investment Forum (US SIF).\n\nMany Republican-led states are dropping companies with ESG policies as eligible managers for their pensions funds. But large managers like the Big Three have substantial accounts with Democratic-led states and European clients that are under their own stakeholder and regulatory pressure to meet climate and ESG targets. US SIF reported that sustainable assets under management at the end of 2023 were US$6.5 trillion, representing 12% of total investment assets in the United States.\n\nThe takeaway: ESG strategies have become embedded in a large proportion of the long-term asset-owner and -management sectors. Expect continued growth of sustainable finance assets by these investors in 2025, especially by pension funds weighing the evolving risks of heat, floods and storms and economic transformations from climate change.\n\nRelated\n\nSustainable investors are split on just how bad Trump will be for the green economy\n\nDeath of ESG is greatly exaggerated, say pension managers\n\nWhy this investor advocate quit filing oil and gas shareholder proposals\n\nShorter-term mutual fund and ETF investors will cautiously re-enter the sustainable funds market\n\nUnlike core ESG investors committed to long-term sustainable strategies, interest by small institutions and individuals with shorter investment horizons has waned in recent years. Inflows in sustainable mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs), two products popular with these investors, hit US$160 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, triggered by low interest rates and climate-friendly policies in the European Union. But these dropped precipitously starting in 2022, when central banks ramped up interest rates, the Ukraine war drove up energy prices, and Europe established more stringent anti-greenwash fund-disclosure rules.\n\nBy the second quarter of 2024, Morningstar estimates that net inflows had dropped to US$6.3 billion, with the United States registering net outflows. Not surprisingly, Morningstar estimates there were 246 new sustainable funds launched in the first three quarters of 2024, down from 444 in the same period in 2023.\n\nBut there are early signs this outflow is beginning to turn around. Global flows into sustainable mutual funds and ETFs hit US$10.4 billion in net new money in the third quarter of 2024, driven largely by reduced outflows from the United States. It appears investors are gaining comfort with the new European rules and longer-term prospects for green stocks, although there was a sell-off of clean energy immediately after the U.S. election.\n\nThe takeaway: Expect sustainable mutual fund and ETF inflows to bottom out in 2025 and investors to return to these products, as long-term interest rates improve conditions for green bonds and climate-friendly stocks and European investors become more familiar with ESG fund-disclosure rules.\n\nEurope will simplify, not throw out, ESG disclosure rules\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has proposed an \u201comnibus\u201d reform of corporate and finance disclosure rules aimed at simplifying the complex web of ESG reporting requirements imposed by the European Union. \u201cThe questions we are asking, the data points we are collecting \u2013 thousands of them \u2013 is too much,\u201d she said at a meeting of EU heads of state last year.\n\nThe political balance at the European Parliament shifted to conservative parties in 2024 elections, sparking a fear of wholesale disclosure deregulation. But with thousands of companies investing in resources to meet the stringent rules this year, the European Commission would invite significant blowback and market confusion if it threw out the reporting regime.\n\nThe takeaway: Look for the European Commission to overhaul the information requirements in 2025, in a spirit of getting to the core of sustainability outcomes, not tossing out the whole framework in a U.S.-style attack on ESG.\n\nCanada will become a leader on transition investing\n\nCanada is expected to appoint an arm\u2019s-length council in 2025 to oversee a new green and transition taxonomy, an official standard for banks, funds and asset managers on green and transition investments.\n\nOne of the big questions is whether gas projects like liquefied natural gas infrastructure will qualify for the \u201ctransition\u201d label. Guidelines set by the federal government in 2024 rule out new gas production for the transition label. Existing natural gas production displacing coal could be transition-eligible but would have to be aligned with a global temperature rise of no more than 1.5\u00b0C. These are important marching orders for the arm\u2019s-length council, which will likely follow the federal mandate to rule out projects with significant carbon lock-in.\n\nThe takeaway: The taxonomy will help Canada to become a leader in transition projects in areas such as green steel and cement and the gradual phaseout of fossil fuel power with clean energy. That is, if the taxonomy is even finalized under the precarious situation facing the current government.\n\nCanada will impose mandatory full-scope carbon emission reporting \u2013 but it won\u2019t come in 2025\n\nIn December, the Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB) adopted international accounting rules calling on Canadian corporations to report the full range of their carbon emissions. That is, not only Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from operations and energy, but also Scope 3 emissions from end uses.\n\nHowever, the rules include a two-year delay for Scope 1 and 2 reporting and a further year for Scope 3 reporting. It\u2019s now up to the Canadian Securities Administrators, the umbrella organization for securities commissions, to decide whether to follow through on the CSSB recommendation and make full carbon-emission disclosure mandatory.\n\nThe takeaway: Alberta will almost surely fight full disclosure, since the oil and gas industry is responsible for about 30% of Canada\u2019s total emissions, particularly on Scope 3. But I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and predict that the other provinces will win this battle, backing the CSSB\u2019s carefully crafted consensus to bring Canada into alignment with Europe and many other jurisdictions in 2027 and 2028.\n\nThe big picture\n\nStronger-than-expected anti-ESG attacks in the United States or Europe could put a very cold chill on green investing in 2025, but right now it looks like sustainable investing has built sufficient strength in the last decade to withstand the growing conservative backlash against it.\n\nEugene Ellmen writes on sustainable business and finance. He is a former executive director of the Canadian Social Investment Organization (now the Responsible Investment Association)."

            "search_summary": "The Reality of ESG: Palm Oil Corporate Interests in West Sulawesi, Indonesia\u00a0\u00a0Modern Diplomacy",
            "article_text": "In recent years, the palm oil industry in West Sulawesi has become an issue relevant to the Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) discussion. Behind promising economic growth and investment, there are serious social and environmental problems. ESG principles, which should be a reference for a corporation\u2019s operations, are not very relevant to the activities of the palm oil corporation in West Sulawesi. The practice of massive deforestation to clear land for plantations has led to a reduction in forest area, threatening wildlife habitat, and disrupting the balance of the ecosystem. On the other hand, local communities living around companies often experience marginalization, loss of location, and poor working conditions.\n\nIt is important to note that ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) is a framework used to assess the sustainable performance of a corporation by considering environmental, social, and governance aspects (Li et al., 2021). In this context, ESG helps various parties such as investors, stakeholders, and the general public to evaluate the corporation\u2019s sustainable performance and its impact on the environment, society, and corporate governance itself. In addition, ESG principles also encourage corporations to integrate environmental, social, and governance considerations into company operations and strategic decision-making.\n\nPalm Oil Industry in West Sulawesi\n\nWest Sulawesi is one of the regions in Indonesia that has a large area of \u200b\u200boil palm plantations. Data from the Central Statistics Agency of West Sulawesi in 2023 shows that the area of \u200b\u200boil palm plantations in West Sulawesi reached 108,443.89 hectares in 2022. Many oil palm corporations are operating in West Sulawesi including, PT Astra Agro Lestari (AAL) which has five subsidiaries namely PT Pasangkayu, PT Mamuang, PT Letawa, PT Lestari Tani Teladan (LTT), PT Surya Raya Lestari I, PT Surya Lestari II, and PT Badra Sukses. In addition, some companies are not part of the Astra group, namely PT Toscano, PT Prima Nusa Global Lestari, PT Trinity Palmas Plantation, PT Wahana Karya Sejahtera Mandiri, PT Manakarra Unggul Lestari (MUL), PT Tunas Fajar Perkasa (TFP), PT Surya Raya Lestari (SRL), and so on. These companies are spread across three districts in West Sulawesi, namely Pasangkayu, Central Mamuju, and Mamuju (Daniel, 2024).\n\nHowever, palm oil corporations in West Sulawesi also face challenges related to environmental conservation, social responsibility, and corporate governance practices. The reason is that the efforts of oil palm corporations to obtain maximum profits often make them ignore ESG principles, which ultimately sacrifice human rights, environmental preservation, and sustainable development. This can be seen from the increasing cases of environmental damage and human rights violations committed by several oil palm corporations in West Sulawesi in recent years.\n\nTable 1. Planted Area of Oil Palm by Regency in West Sulawesi (ha), 2021 and 2022\n\nRegency Oil Palm 2021 2022 Majene Polewali Mandar 1 951,10 1 951,10 Mamasa Mamuju 10 079,68 10 400,25 Pasangkayu 59 933,00 59 933,39 Mamuju Tengah 36 159,15 36 159,15 Sulawesi Barat 108 122,93 108 443,89\n\n(Sourse: Badan Pusat Statistik)\n\nPutting ESG Dimensions aside for Corporate Interests\n\nTo maximize their profits, Palm Oil Corporations in West Sulawesi are always trying to expand their plantation areas. However, the expansion of oil palm plantations by corporations has contributed to the rate of deforestation in West Sulawesi. According to the author\u2019s virtual interview with an academic who is a native of Pasangkayu District (FA), oil palm corporations often sacrifice forest areas to expand their plantations. Some of these plantations are allegedly located in protected forest areas. This accelerates climate change, destroys the habitat of forest-dependent wildlife, and triggers water scarcity.\n\nAnother problem is waste from palm oil mills. In Kalola Village in Pasangkayu District, West Sulawesi, palm oil mill effluent from PT Toscano Indah Pratama has polluted the surrounding environment due to the absence of a good wastewater management system at the company. As a result, the palm oil mill effluent caused a decrease in water quality in several areas in Pasangkayu, created unpleasant odors, and caused inconvenience to the local community (Irwan et al., 2021). The mill effluents also polluted the river. Thousands of fish died in the Barakkang River in West Sulawesi because the river was polluted by palm oil mill effluent. In addition, waste from palm oil mills also caused fish deaths in ponds in Kasano Village, Baras Subdistrict, Pasangkayu District in 2022 (Masalembo, 2022).\n\nAnother ESG aspect that is often overlooked by palm oil corporations in West Sulawesi is the social aspect, particularly about human rights. In pursuit of huge profits from the palm oil industry, palm oil corporations in West Sulawesi often unilaterally claim land belonging to local communities. For example, PT Mamuang, a subsidiary of PT Astra Agro Lestari, claimed land owned by the Kaili tribe in Pasangkayu. The land had been managed by the Kaili tribe long before oil palm plantations entered their area. PT Mamuang also used security forces to arrest residents who were fighting for their rights (Rusdianto, 2019).\n\nIn Ako Village, West Sulawesi, around 748 hectares of forest and customary land owned by the local community have been claimed and controlled by an oil palm corporation, PT Pasangkayu. As a result, the local community lost the forest that was their source of livelihood. Worse, PT Pasangkayu not only took over the community\u2019s land but also displaced their ancestral graves and damaged or destroyed the community\u2019s church building. This is not the first claim made by PT Pasangkayu. Previously, the company had also claimed 400 hectares of community rice fields in Karya Bersama village (Daniel, 2024).\n\nAnother example is the land grabbing by PT Letawa in Lariang village of some land owned by residents that has been managed for 10 years. Around 200 hectares of land were claimed by PT Letawa as part of their ownership. These cases are just some of the many cases of land grabbing by palm oil corporations in West Sulawesi. Instead of ensuring that their operations do not violate human rights, the presence of a palm oil corporation in West Sulawesi has caused unrest in the community.\n\nWest Sulawesi also ranks top in terms of the number of child labor in Indonesia (BPS, 2024). One factor contributing to this is the palm oil industry. The involvement of children in work in this industry raises various social and ethical issues. These children often work in high-risk conditions, with inadequate safety and low wages for the benefit of the palm oil corporation. While many of these children are not under direct contract with the corporation and are simply assisting their parents on the corporation\u2019s palm oil plantations, the corporation must still take responsibility to ensure there is no child labor in their operations.\n\nIn terms of governance, decision-making by palm oil corporations in West Sulawesi often does not take into account the interests of all stakeholders, especially local communities. Decisions are sometimes not in line with the principles of business ethics and do not comply with applicable regulations and governance standards. For example, four palm oil corporations in Central Mamuju, West Sulawesi, namely PT Prima Nusa Global Lestari, PT Trinity Palmas Plantation, PT Wahana Karya Sejahtera Mandiri, and PT Astra Agro Lestari 2, unilaterally lowered the price of farmers\u2019 oil palm Fresh Fruit Bunches (TBS) to around IDR 1,700-1,940 per kg. In fact, the West Sulawesi provincial government has set the TBS price at around Rp 3,000-3,100 per kg.\n\nIn addition, palm oil corporations in West Sulawesi also lack transparent policies and practices. It is rare for corporations to conduct regular monitoring and reporting on the environmental and social impacts of industry activities. They also lack stakeholder engagement to ensure their concerns are heard and addressed. One Pasangkayu resident (FA) said that palm oil corporations in West Sulawesi, especially in Pasangkayu, have never conducted socialization or reporting on environmental and social impacts. The lack of transparency in the governance of palm oil corporations in West Sulawesi may hinder efforts to track other issues related to palm oil industry activities, and it will be difficult to hold companies accountable for their actions. Without clear visibility, it will be difficult to ensure that palm oil is sourced sustainably and ethically.\n\n\u201cThere is no socialization in the community! because the system they built is only limited to the relationship between workers and superiors. socialization is only carried out to the company\u2019s partner farmers. the company here is profit-oriented, so all activities are always directed towards profit only\u201d\n\n(Virtual interview with FA, Pasangkayu resident, 2024)\n\nThe reality of the dynamics of palm oil corporations in West Sulawesi shows that the application of ESG dimensions as a framework that should guide companies is not optimally implemented in the operations of palm oil corporations. The corporation\u2019s efforts to achieve interests quickly and maximally, ultimately make them ignore environmental issues, social aspects, and sustainable corporate governance. Local communities become the most disadvantaged party. Because environmental problems and poor governance will ultimately have an impact on the community, and potentially lead to other social problems.\n\nThe importance of a new, more comprehensive, and integrated approach\n\nPalm oil ccorporation in West Sulawesi should implement a more comprehensive and integrated corporate operational strategy. They can engage local communities and stakeholders more transparently, including consulting with indigenous groups and local farmers to ensure their voices are heard and their rights respected. In addition, corporations should invest in sustainable agricultural practices and biodiversity conservation to reduce environmental impacts. By collaborating with stakeholders and implementing responsible practices, corporation can help realize a more sustainable and ethical palm oil industry in West Sulawesi.\n\nThis not only benefits the environment and local communities but also improves the reputation and credibility of corporation operating in the area. By prioritizing transparency and responsibility in their activities, corporation can gain the trust of stakeholders and demonstrate their commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Finally, a cooperative approach between corporation and local communities is essential for the long-term success and sustainability of the palm oil industry in West Sulawesi based on ESG principles."

            "article_text": "Listen to this story:\n\nForbes Middle East has announced its fourth annual list of the Top 100 CEOs in the region, shining a spotlight on the leaders driving success across diverse industries. This year\u2019s list celebrates a range of executives, with Emiratis leading the charge with 27 entries, followed by Egyptians (21) and Saudis (14). The CEOs featured represent sectors such as banking, real estate, telecommunications, and more. Topping the list is Amin H. Nasser, President & CEO of Saudi Aramco, continuing his reign as the leader of one of the world\u2019s largest oil companies.\n\nThe Top 10 CEOs in the Middle East for 2024\n\nSee the full list of top 100 CEOs here\n\nThese executives lead companies that are not only massive contributors to their economies but are also shaping the future of the Middle East through innovation, diversification, and sustainability.\n\nMethodology Behind the Rankings\n\nTo develop this prestigious list, Forbes Middle East evaluated CEOs based on their impact on the region, their companies\u2019 size, and their accomplishments over the past year. Key metrics included revenues, assets, market capitalization, and the innovations and initiatives spearheaded by the CEOs. Only CEOs of companies headquartered in the MENA region were considered, ensuring the list reflects regional leadership.\n\nExecutives who demonstrated a clear focus on innovation and sustainability were especially recognized. From the establishment of new ventures to the implementation of green initiatives, these CEOs are not just leading in profits but also in environmental and societal progress.\n\nSustainability and Corporate Responsibility\n\nSustainability is becoming a crucial element in the long-term success of businesses in the Middle East, particularly as the region transitions from its reliance on fossil fuels. As reflected in a recent PwC survey, 80% of business leaders in the region now have formal sustainability strategies, with over half integrating them into their operations.\n\nRegional leaders like Abdulrahman Al Hatmi of Asyad Group and Said Zater of Contact Financial Holding are prime examples of CEOs incorporating sustainability into their businesses. Al Hatmi launched Hafeet Rail and opened the Asyad Container Terminal, pushing for more efficient logistics. Zater\u2019s launch of a financing program for electric vehicles also demonstrates a clear alignment with sustainability goals.\n\nBeyond these individual efforts, regional giants like Saudi Aramco, ADNOC, and Qatar Energy play critical roles in shaping the global energy landscape. These companies have increasingly focused on implementing sustainable practices in response to investor expectations and global climate initiatives. Khaled Bin Braik, Consulting Partner and Emiratisation Leader at PwC, highlights the importance of this movement, stating, \u201cPeople are at the center of the ESG agenda. The engagement of employees is critical to progress on the sustainability roadmap.\u201d\n\nThe Intersection of Sustainability and Employee Engagement\n\nWhile companies focus heavily on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives, a gap remains between corporate sustainability efforts and employee priorities. PwC\u2019s survey revealed that employees are more concerned with fair pay and career development than ESG efforts. Yet, bridging this gap is vital for meaningful organizational change. Companies that effectively embed ESG principles into their culture see improved employee retention, with 82% of employees more likely to stay when these values are integrated into the workplace.\n\nThe future of the Middle East\u2019s largest companies depends not only on financial success but also on the ability to foster a culture that values sustainability. As Khaled Bin Braik emphasizes,\n\n\u201cPeople are at the centre of the ESG agenda. The engagement of the employees is critical to progress on the sustainability roadmap. ESG is an emotive topic and employees respond differently to it and engage at varying levels. Being perceptive of the employee sentiments and astutely designing personalised approaches to engage diverse employee groups can ensure that employees feel included and play their part in achieving the sustainability goals. It is in the interest of everyone that corporate leaders foster a culture where ESG is a core component of ways of working, and all employees feel enabled to make a positive contribution.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, Forbes Middle East\u2019s 2024 list of the Top 100 CEOs highlights a new generation of leadership that is pushing boundaries in both economic achievement and sustainability. These leaders are not only steering their companies through a rapidly changing global landscape but also paving the way for a more sustainable future in the Middle East."
