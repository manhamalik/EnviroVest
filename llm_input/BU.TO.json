The concept of environmental, social and governance (ESG) has become almost ubiquitous. ESG generally refers to the environmental, social, and governance factors that can affect company value and investor decisions. In this article, we briefly outline some key considerations for managing ESG litigation and regulatory risk for Canadian companies making ESG claims. We also highlight some relevant cases as examples. What you need to know Strong ESG performance is valued by many shareholders and consumers, and can be a way to differentiate your brand, although implementing ESG measures comes with risk.\n\nFailure to take sufficient action on ESG matters can risk proxy contests and harm to a company\u2019s business. Businesses should be aware of and understand their legal obligations with respect to disclosure of ESG information, as failure to comply can result in enforcement and other sanctions. However, adopting ESG measures can also lead to legal challenges, including by disgruntled shareholders or by groups who feel that the company has not lived up to its stated ESG policies.\n\nCompanies should routinely audit, revise and update their ESG frameworks and disclosure to confirm that they reflect their current operations and ever-evolving industry best practices. Companies should choose an appropriate ESG framework for their intended audience.\n\nTo reduce the risk of misstatements or inconsistent statements, boards and management should have a proactive process for reviewing and approving ESG disclosure prior to its public release. A robust legal review is also advisable.\n\nESG disclosures should be entity-specific, measurable, and grounded in verifiable data. ESG overview Although akin to the concept of corporate social responsibility, ESG relates to factors that are financially material to a company\u2019s business and includes such wide-ranging considerations as climate change, sustainability, forced labour and child labour (commonly referred to as \u201cmodern slavery\u201d), and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Recent years have seen growing market and shareholder demand for businesses to implement and report on their ESG commitments and performance. In response to this demand, companies are increasingly identifying, measuring, and disclosing ESG factors that are material to their operations. While in the past this disclosure was largely voluntary, recent years have seen many levels of government adopt ESG factors as part of their mandatory reporting requirements, which has inevitably led to an expanded risk of litigation and other attempts to hold companies accountable for their claims. Companies should proceed with caution: there has been a more recent trend of ESG backlash, and disgruntled stakeholders may challenge the company if they feel that ESG measures have gone too far. ESG litigation ESG litigation and regulatory risks generally fall into two broad categories. The first category includes allegations of false ESG claims or misrepresentations in a company\u2019s ESG disclosure. Companies risk both regulatory action and consumer- or investor-led class actions related to alleged misrepresentations.1 The second category of litigation risk includes claims directly challenging a company\u2019s ESG-related conduct or perceived lapses in ESG action. Trends in Canada, and globally, include attempts to hold companies accountable for conduct by suppliers or subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions2 and to subject companies to litigation for the contribution of their greenhouse gas emissions to climate change.3 However, on the flip side, sometimes companies engaging in active ESG measures risk challenges to their ESG policies for allegedly going too far. Even if a company can successfully defend a claim on the merits, being forced to defend an ESG record or ESG policies can be costly and lead to reputational harm. Historically, many ESG programs and reports have had little legal oversight or input. To manage the risk of litigation and regulatory or administrative sanctions, businesses should proactively seek experienced legal assistance to review how they are addressing ESG issues while guarding against overstating their commitments and actions. Businesses should also consult with management, counsel, and relevant subject matter experts to help protect against claims that the ESG policies were not adopted in the business\u2019s best interests. Key considerations\n\nFailure to take sufficient action on ESG matters can risk proxy contests and other corporate challenges, causing harm to a company\u2019s business. A recent proxy contest between ExxonMobil and Engine No. 1 demonstrates the growing power of ESG to alter even the largest of public companies.4 In May 2021, Engine No. 1, an activist hedge fund with only 0.02 per cent ownership in ExxonMobil, argued that there were shortcomings in oil and gas experience on ExxonMobil\u2019s board, slow strategic transitioning to a low carbon economy, and historic underperformance and overleverage relative to peers. Engine No. 1 proposed four board director candidates, three of whom were elected to the 12-member board, ousting three sitting board members. Engine No. 1\u2019s campaign gained the support of three large investors in ExxonMobil \u2013 Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. Although the impacts of Engine No. 1\u2019s activism within ExxonMobil are the subject of debate,5 Engine No. 1\u2019s success in changing the board of ExxonMobil may be a harbinger of things to come for Canadian public companies, particularly those in natural resources sectors. Large institutional investors in Canada are increasingly expecting businesses to take action on ESG matters. On November 25, 2020, CEOs of eight Canadian pension plan investment managers, representing approximately $1.6 trillion of assets under management, issued a joint statement calling on companies to measure and disclose their performance on material and industry-relevant ESG factors. On June 28, 2023, CEOs of eleven Canadian pension plan investment managers, representing approximately $2 trillion in assets under management, issued a joint statement calling on companies to embrace the new International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) disclosure framework, which we discuss further below. Two leading proxy advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholders Services (ISS) have publicly stated they may recommend voting against certain public company board members if a company does not adequately address or disclose ESG matters. As outlined in their 2024 Benchmark Policy guidelines, Glass Lewis will \u201cgenerally recommend\u201d voting against the governance chair of a company in the S&P/TSX Composite index that does not to their satisfaction provide clear disclosure concerning board-level oversight afforded to environmental and/or social issues. Additionally, Glass Lewis strongly encourages companies whose greenhouse gas emissions are a financial material risk to provide thorough disclosure consistent with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidelines. If the board member responsible for monitoring climate-related issues fails to ensure compliance with disclosure, Glass Lewis recommends voting against that member. Likewise, ISS has stated that under \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d it will recommend voting against or withholding a vote for directors, committee members, or an entire board where there has been demonstrably poor risk oversight of environmental and social issues, including expressly climate change. Considering the guarded language used in these policy guidelines (i.e., \u201cgenerally recommend\u201d and \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d), there is a considerable grey area as to if, and when, they will be invoked. Nevertheless, the guidelines signify a shift and increased consideration of ESG by institutional advisors. Companies may face hurdles when trying to publicly list their securities or execute on ESG-related strategy. While the following are not Canadian examples, global trends often signal what is to come for Canadian businesses. In 2022, Ithaca Energy plc, an oil and gas producer, sought to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. During this process, it successfully submitted a prospectus for approval by the Financial Conduct Authority. ClientEarth, an environmental law charity, applied for permission to apply for judicial review of the Authority\u2019s approval of the prospectus on the basis that the prospectus failed to meet climate change risk disclosure standards; however, ClientEarth\u2019s claim was unsuccessful.6 In 2023, ClientEarth, as a minority shareholder in Shell, sought to bring a derivative action against Shell\u2019s board of directors, alleging they breached their duties under the U.K.\u2019s Companies Act 2006 by failing to adopt and implement an energy transition strategy that aligns with the Paris Agreement. ClientEarth successfully established a prima facie case that \u201cShell faces material and foreseeable risks as a result of climate change which have or could have a material effect on it\u201d. Nonetheless, ClientEarth\u2019s action was ultimately unsuccessful, as Shell\u2019s directors had a climate change plan in place and ClientEarth\u2019s real interest was \u201cnot in how best to promote the success of Shell for the benefit of its members as a whole\u201d.7 Even if ultimately unsuccessful, challenges like these can be costly, create delay, and cause reputational harm. All this suggests it may be prudent for companies to proactively undertake ESG measures. However, any action on ESG measures must be informed and in the best interests of the company. Recently, a shareholder derivative action was launched in Washington state challenging Starbucks\u2019 diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The action was launched by a conservative advocacy group, which owns 56 shares of Starbucks stock and which is purportedly \u201cengaged in a nationwide campaign to litigate against so-called \u2018woke\u2019 corporate practices concerning issues of [DEI]\u201d. The advocacy group demanded that Starbucks retract its DEI initiatives and subsequently filed a shareholder derivative action claiming for declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of federal and state law, including breach of fiduciary duty. The action was ultimately dismissed as the advocacy group did not fairly and adequately represent the interests of Starbucks or its shareholders; instead, the action was filed to advance the group\u2019s own political and public policy agendas. The court also considered that Starbucks had engaged in careful deliberation before determining it should not retract the challenged initiatives, and thus the advocacy group failed to rebut the presumption that the Board had acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in an honest belief that rejecting the group\u2019s demand to retract the DEI initiatives was in the best interests of Starbucks.8 Relatedly, a conservative-funded organization, Americans for Fair Treatment, filed an action in New York alleging that three pension funds breached their fiduciary duty when they decided to divest from fossil fuel holdings. The complaint alleges that the decision is \u201cineffectual\u201d to address climate change and was made \u201cwithout regard for whether [the sold-off] assets would produce a superior return\u201d for the pension plans. The pension funds have applied to dismiss the claims.9 These cases demonstrate that companies must engage in a sound process before adopting ESG initiatives. If ESG initiatives go too far and are no longer defensible as being in the best interests of the company, the initiatives may be open to challenge by investors or other groups opposed to such policies.\n\nStrong ESG performance is valued by many shareholders and consumers, and can be a way to differentiate your brand.26 There are good reasons to consider voluntary ESG disclosures beyond what may be required by regulation. However, as discussed above, there are also some risks, including from shareholders and consumers opposed to the adoption of voluntary ESG measures. Companies should routinely audit and revise their ESG frameworks to confirm that they are up to date with their operations and ever-evolving industry best practices. To help mitigate the risk of voluntary ESG disclosures, a company should carefully consider the framework it uses to measure and report ESG factors. Following industry best practices in ESG disclosure may support a company\u2019s claims that it acted with due diligence or met the appropriate standard of care in making ESG statements. It may also support a company\u2019s claims that any ESG statements or initiatives were undertaken in the best interests of the company. There are a variety of respected ESG disclosure standards and frameworks that businesses might consider adopting. For example, the Global Reporting Initiative provides standards to measure social and governance issues, in addition to environmental factors. The UNGPs, the OECD Guidelines and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy provide internationally-recognized due diligence frameworks for human rights and social issues. The UN Sustainable Development Goals is another source for respected ESG framework standards. However, businesses should be aware that a number of ESG standards have converged into the ISSB, which is intended to provide a global standard for sustainability disclosure. In June 2023, the ISSB issued their voluntary standards for sustainability-related risks and opportunities and climate-related disclosures, IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. They are consistent with IFRS accounting standards, and sustainability disclosures are meant to be connected with information in financial statements. The new standards incorporate the TCFD recommendations, and consolidate other disclosure frameworks, allowing companies to easily comply with both. A comparison of IFRS S2 and TCFD recommendations was released in July 2023. The ISSB hopes these standards will be adopted across many jurisdictions with the help of a Transition Implementation Group, which will support companies that apply the standards.27 It is likely that these standards will be adopted, in some form, in Canada: the Government of Canada has expressed support for the development and adoption of the standards and, in June 2023, Financial Reporting & Assurance Standards Canada finalized the membership of the Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB), which will partner with the ISSB to support uptake of the ISSB standards. Between March 13, 2024 and June 10, 2024, the CSSB invited consultation on its proposed Canadian Sustainability Disclosure Standards, which align with the ISSB standards. As well, as discussed above, the CSA has indicated it will conduct further consultations to adopt disclosure standards based on the ISSB standards, with modifications for the Canadian market. BLG provided a more detailed analysis of these new standards in a previous article. In selecting a standard, a business should first consider its audience and then determine the appropriate disclosure framework for that audience. In selecting an appropriate disclosure framework, businesses should identify the ESG factors that present the most significant risks and opportunities to the issuer over the short, medium, and long term. This will involve consideration of the company\u2019s operations, supply chain, and broader industry trends. However, businesses should be mindful of the trend towards adopting the ISSB standards as a unified, global standard when making their selection.\n\nGlobally there has been increased regulatory action and litigation related to false or misleading ESG claims. In recent years, regulators in the United States and Canada have been actively pursuing companies for alleged misstatements and deceptive claims. For example, under provincial environmental legislation relating to greenhouse gas emissions reduction, Alberta recently filed charges against a carbon offset firm for providing false information related to their carbon offsets and for acting as a third-party assurance provider without the required qualifications. This marks the first time a Canadian province has charged a third party verifier or assurer, and signifies the importance of carefully verifying carbon offsets and using a qualified verifier. In total, Alberta Environment and Protected Areas filed 25 charges against Amberg Corp and Olga Kiiker for not following environmental legislation. Olga Kiiker pleaded guilty to one of the charges, and was sentenced to pay a $10,000 fine, prohibited from employment in that area for three years, and is required to prepare an article for publication in 2024 as part of a creative sentencing order. Under Canadian securities legislation, issuers that make misrepresentations may be subject to civil liability for secondary market disclosure. For example, in 2021, the CSA, including the Ontario Securities Commission and British Columbia Securities Commission, conducted desk reviews or \u201csweeps\u201d of ESG practices and claims of select investment fund managers, portfolio managers, and exempt market dealers identified as participants in ESG investing. This follows a similar review by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Following the ESG sweeps and the original publication of CSA Staff Notice 81-334, discussed above, BLG published a survey of best practices. Under the Canadian Competition Act28 and provincial consumer protection laws, businesses can face regulatory action and civil liability for false, misleading, or deceptive ESG claims. The Competition Bureau has been active in investigating and imposing fines for false or misleading environmental claims. In 2022, the Competition Bureau settled with Keurig respecting false or misleading claims about the recyclability of single-use Keurig K-Cup pods. As part of the settlement, Keurig agreed to pay a $3 million penalty, donate $800,000 to a charitable organization focused on environmental causes, pay $85,000 for the Bureau\u2019s costs of investigation, change its claims and packaging, publish corrective notices, and enhance its corporate compliance program. As another example, in November 2021, Greenpeace Canada filed a complaint with the Competition Bureau concerning Shell Canada\u2019s Drive Carbon Neutral program, arguing that the claims made by Shell under the \u201cprogram\u201d constituted \u201cgreenwashing\u201d. The Competition Bureau terminated its examination of the Drive Carbon Neutral representations after Shell removed them from its Canadian website and app. Greenpeace Canada made a similar complaint against Pathways Alliance, a syndicate of Canada\u2019s largest oil sands producers, including Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Cenovus Energy, ConocoPhillips Canada, Imperial, Meg Energy, and Suncor Energy. Greenpeace Canada took aim at Pathways Alliance\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s clear the air\u201d marketing campaigns, alleging that the group\u2019s plan to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is misleading in that it does not account for the emissions produced when its fossil fuels are burned. In May 2023, the Competition Bureau announced that it would launch an investigation into the marketing practices of the Pathways Alliance. The Competition Bureau also launched an inquiry against the Canadian Gas Association following six complaints alleging it made false and misleading representation that natural gas is \u201cclean\u201d and \u201caffordable\u201d. A similar inquiry against RBC has been launched regarding its messaging on climate action. The complaints allege that RBC has marketed itself as being aligned with the climate goals of the Paris Agreement while continuing to finance the fossil fuel industry. More recently, a complaint was filed with the Competition Bureau against Lululemon, alleging that Lululemon\u2019s \u201cBe Planet\u201d campaign, which highlights the use of recycled fabrics and pledges to reduce GHG emissions, is greenwashing. The Competition Bureau has yet to make a determination on these investigations and complaints. In November of 2022, the federal government launched a review of the Canadian Competition Act.29 On November 30, 2023, Bill C-59 was introduced in Parliament. The Bill proposed many amendments to the Competition Act, including increases to monetary penalties and the expansion of private actions. The Bill also introduced an explicit prohibition against greenwashing statements.30 While the Competition Act already designated public misrepresentations as reviewable conduct, the amendments make explicit that representations about a product\u2019s or business activity\u2019s \u201cbenefits for protecting or restoring the environment or mitigating the environmental, social and ecological causes or effects of climate change that [are] not based on an adequate and proper\u201d test or substantiation are reviewable conduct. The Bill received royal assent on June 20, 2024.31 The Bill\u2019s passing prompted Pathways Alliance to remove its website, social media and other communications, citing uncertainty in how Bill C-59 will be interpreted and applied. In a recent development, the Modern Slavery Act, discussed above, includes liability for making a false or misleading statement in a report or other statement to the Minister in relation to the Act. As such, reporting entities and their directors and officers could face prosecution where they misrepresent or materially overstate the approach to supply chain due diligence. The United States also provides several examples of regulatory action relating to false or misleading ESG claims. For example, the Attorney General of New York brought a lawsuit against ExxonMobil, alleging that ExxonMobil was publishing a misleading proxy cost of carbon. The lawsuit was dismissed, but a similar case brought by the Massachusetts Attorney General and shareholders continues to proceed.32 In California, then-Attorney General Kamala Harris brought \u201cgreenwashing\u201d lawsuits against companies for alleged misrepresentations about products being recyclable. Private parties in the United States and internationally are now filing greenwashing lawsuits of their own against companies.33 Recently, the Supreme Court of the State of Hawaii permitted tort litigation by Honolulu government entities against oil and gas producers to proceed. The government entities allege the oil and gas companies \u201cengaged in a deceptive promotion campaign and misled the public about the dangers of using their oil and gas products\u201d:34 in other words, they allegedly engaged in a version of greenwashing where they used \u201c\u2018sophisticated disinformation campaigns to cast doubt on the science, causes, and effects of global warming\u2019\u201d. In 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought several enforcement actions to address ESG issues. This included charges against a Deutsche Bank subsidiary on the grounds that it had made materially misleading statements about its ESG policies: while the company purported to be a \u201cleader\u201d in ESG that had specific policies in place to ensure it considered ESG when making its investments, it allegedly failed to adopt and implement policies and procedures that would ensure these public statements were accurate. The company paid a $19 million penalty to settle the charges. Actions for false or misleading claims may also be launched in response to inadequate ESG programs and initiatives aimed at the \u201cS\u201d (social) in ESG. Companies that inadequately address the social pillar of ESG run the risk of organizing greenwashing or social washing initiatives which may give rise to unintended legal and commercial consequences. For example, Oscar Wylee, an Australian eyewear chain, was fined $3.5 million for falsely advertising that it would donate a pair of glasses to charity for every pair sold. In court, the company admitted to only donating 3,181 frames without lenses to charity even though it had sold 328,101 pairs of glasses. Oscar Wylee\u2019s failed follow through on this social initiative resulted in legal repercussions, financial loss, and a tarnished reputation. Canadian businesses would be well advised to review their ESG disclosures with these legal trends in mind. In addition to regulatory action, companies that make ESG claims may find themselves subject to private litigation, including proposed class proceedings, and even claims from competitors. For example, carmakers have been subject to class proceedings in Canada and other jurisdictions arising from environmental statements about emissions from diesel vehicle engines. These class proceedings against carmakers have generally included allegations of breaches of the Competition Act, consumer protection legislation, negligence, and unjust enrichment. For example, a class action claiming $1.5 billion in damages was certified against Ford Motor Company in relation to the EnerGuide labels affixed to Ford\u2019s 2013 and 2014 vehicles, though the claim was summarily dismissed in mid-2022.35 Sometimes, companies face class actions in addition to competition complaints: for example, Keurig, despite its settlement with the Competition Bureau, is facing class actions in British Columbia, Ontario, and the Federal Court for alleged misleading or deceptive marketing practices relating to the K-Cup coffee pods.36 Recently, in British Columbia an environmental group launched a lawsuit against FortisBC, accusing it of greenwashing its natural gas supply by exaggerating how much of its gas comes from renewable sources. As well, in a landmark decision, a civil court in Italy granted a company an interim injunction against its competitor, ordering it to stop making \u201cvague, false, and non-verifiable green claims\u201d.37 Alcantara, a manufacturer of a microfiber product used in the automotive sector, sued Miko, one of its main Italian competitors that also markets a microfiber product, for making misleading \u201cgreen claims\u201d about its products. Miko claimed its products were \u201c100 per cent recyclable\u201d, \u201c100 per cent recyclable at the end of its lifecycle\u201d, \u201ceco-friendly microfiber\u201d, \u201cthe first and only microfiber that guarantees environmental sustainability throughout the productive cycle\u201d, and more. The Court ruled that these statements were vague, generic, false, and non-verifiable, and needed to be immediately removed from all promotional materials. The Court also required Miko to publish the Court\u2019s decision on its website for 60 days. The orders were later appealed and overturned in March 2022 on the basis that Alcantara was unable to provide any evidence that Miko\u2019s environmental claims had resulted in a risk of loss of customers for Alcantara. Nonetheless, the case demonstrates the possible legal, financial, and reputational repercussions a company can face from making greenwashing statements. Along similar lines, the District Court of Amsterdam recently ruled in favour of the campaign group Fossielvrij, which brought a greenwashing case against the airline KLM. The court found that KLM had engaged in misleading advertising in 15 of its 19 environmental statements, including its claims that the airline was moving towards a \u201cmore sustainable\u201d future. The court did not issue any remedies, however, in part because KLM had already retracted the advertisements.38 In the fashion industry, companies have faced greenwashing claims from consumers. For example, in Lizama et al v. H&M Hennes & Mauritz LP, customers who purchased a sweater from H&M\u2019s \u201cconscious choice\u201d collection alleged the product was not actually environmentally friendly, such that the collection\u2019s name was a misrepresentation. While the customers sought to bring a class action, the claim was dismissed in 2023, with the court finding the actual statements were not false or misleading as they were carefully crafted to not overstate the extent to which the products were in fact sustainable.39 Similarly, Allbirds, a shoe company, successfully dismissed a proposed class action by customers alleging that the company\u2019s environmental claims were misleading, as the court found that Allbirds\u2019 website made it clear how its metrics were calculated.40 In both cases the claims were dismissed as the companies used careful language that was found not to overstate or misrepresent. Public companies in the United States have also faced litigation from investors alleging misrepresentations in ESG-related statements. For example, in Texas a securities fraud class action was launched against ExxonMobil alleging that ExxonMobil had misled investors about certain oil and gas operations and about the proxy costs of carbon. In August 2023, the motion to certify the action was granted in part, in relation to the claims about ExxonMobil\u2019s alleged failures to properly account for and disclose losses related to certain bitumen and dry gas operations in Canada.41 It is highly likely that Canada will soon see its own class actions based on alleged prospectus misrepresentation or secondary market representation claims related to ESG matters. In making public statements and prospectus disclosures about ESG factors companies must confirm that these statements do not contain misrepresentations or contradict other disclosures. Where possible, ESG disclosures should be relevant to the specific entity, measurable, and grounded in verifiable data, while adding any necessary caveats and disclaimers. To reduce the risk of misstatements or inconsistent statements, boards and management should have a robust process for reviewing and approving ESG disclosure prior to its public release. A robust legal review is also advisable.\n\nIn addition to litigation and regulatory action based on allegedly false or misleading ESG statements, there is an increasing international trend towards litigation targeting companies\u2019 ESG-related performance, or perceived lack thereof. Canadian companies have faced lawsuits alleging negligence or misconduct by subsidiaries and suppliers in foreign jurisdictions. For the most part, these lawsuits have been unsuccessful to date. For example, in Das v. George Weston Limited, the Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the rejection of a proposed class action brought in Ontario related to the collapse of a building in Bangladesh.42 One of the businesses operating in the building was a sub-supplier that was producing garments for a Canadian clothing retailer at the time. In rejecting the proposed class action, Justice Perell of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice stated, \u201c\u2026[T]he imposition of liability is unfair given that the Defendants are not responsible for the vulnerability of the plaintiffs, did not create the dangerous workplace, had no control over the circumstances that were dangerous, and had no control over the employers or employees or other occupants of Rana Plaza\u201d.43 Claims relating to alleged human rights abuses abroad have seen some limited success, at least at a preliminary stage. For example, in Garcia v. Tahoe Resources Inc., the British Columbia Court of Appeal overturned the stay of a claim against Tahoe Resources in British Columbia based on the alleged actions of private security personnel employed by a mine in Guatemala owned by one of its subsidiaries.44 Similarly, in the earlier case of Choc v. Hudbay Minerals Inc., the Ontario Superior Court of Justice refused to dismiss a claim based on similar facts.45 In Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya, three Eritrean workers brought a claim against Nevsun Resources in British Columbia alleging they were conscripted into forced labour at a mine owned and operated by an Eritrean corporation of which Nevsun was 60 per cent owner.46 Although, as in Garcia, the case settled prior to any decision on its merits, the Supreme Court of Canada in Nevsun confirmed that parent companies can be held liable for breaches of customary international law for actions of their subsidiaries abroad. In other jurisdictions, companies have been subject to litigation endeavouring to hold them liable for the climate-change impacts of their greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, these efforts have been unsuccessful to date, although that has not stopped plaintiffs from trying to bring new and creative claims.47 Recently, in Milieudefensie, the Hague District Court ordered Royal Dutch Shell PLC (Shell) to reduce CO 2 emissions of the Shell group by 45 per cent in 2030, compared to 2019 levels.48 Shell has appealed the decision, and the appeal was heard in April 2024; a decision in the appeal is expected later this year. The Milieudefensie case is also noteworthy for its application of the UNGPs: the case referred to the UNGPs as \u201can authoritative and internationally endorsed \u2018soft law\u2019 instrument\u201d, and found that they were \u201csuitable as a guideline in the interpretation of the unwritten standard of care\u201d.49 Given the status of the UNGPs as a benchmark for human rights and ESG due diligence, it is possible that similar reasoning could be adopted by a common law court in formulating the standard of care in negligence. Climate change litigation has also been brought against, and by, governments. Most climate change litigation in Canada has been directed against the government.50 The claims in Environnement Jeunesse, La Rose and Misdzi Yikh failed at an early stage (with the courts refusing to authorize the proceeding as a class action in the first case, and striking the claims in the latter two), though the Federal Court of Appeal in La Rose and Misdzi Yikh determined that the applicants should be granted leave to amend their s. 7 Charter claims. More recently an Ontario case \u2013 Mathur v. His Majesty the King in Right of Ontario \u2013 was decided on its merits.51 In that case, a group of young Ontarians challenged the Ontario government\u2019s GHG reduction targets on the basis that the targets are unconstitutional and violate Ontario youth and future generations' ss. 7 and 15 Charter rights. While their claim was dismissed, an appeal of the decision was heard in January 2024. The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision is under reserve. Climate change litigation against governments has enjoyed more success abroad. For example, on April 9, 2024, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights found Switzerland in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights for its failure to implement sufficient measures to combat climate change. The Court found that by failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and comply with its positive obligations under the Convention to combat climate change, the Swiss Government had violated Article 8, the right to respect for private life, family life, the home and correspondence, and Article 6\u00a71, access to court.52 Similarly, in Urgenda Foundation v. State of the Netherlands, an environmental organization and a group of 900 Dutch citizens successfully sued the Dutch government to require it to reduce GHG emissions. The Hague District Court ordered the government to limit GHG emissions to 25 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, finding that its existing pledge to reduce emissions by 17 per cent was insufficient to meet the Netherland\u2019s fair contribution towards the UN\u2019s goal of keeping global temperature increase within 2 degrees of pre-industrial conditions. This decision was upheld by the Hague Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of the Netherlands under Article 2, the right to life, and Article 8, the right to respect for private life, family life, the home and correspondence, of the European Convention on Human Rights.53 However, sometimes it is the government that drives environmental litigation. On June 21, 2024, the Province of British Columbia commenced a national class action against manufacturers of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), otherwise known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, to recover the costs of detecting and removing PFAS from drinking-water systems in Canada. The Province alleges the companies negligently designed defective products, negligently failed to warn of the risks, breached the Competition Act, and engaged in civil conspiracy. West Coast Environmental Law has also launched a campaign to start a class action by local governments in British Columbia against oil and gas producers. As of June 20, 2024, some local governments (Gibsons, View Royal, Slocan, Qualicum Beach, Squamish, Burnaby, Port Moody and Sechelt) have made a commitment to the campaign. There is also an increasing trend towards regulatory action targeting companies\u2019 ESG-related performance, or perceived lack thereof. Businesses in the garment, mining, and oil and gas sectors should also be aware of the possibility of a complaint being made to the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise (CORE). The CORE has a mandate to review human rights complaints against Canadian companies operating abroad, make findings about their conduct, and make recommendations to the Minister for International Trade and the company concerned. This can result in the loss of trade support services, as well as reputational losses where reports are published. As of April 2024, there were 22 active complaints before the CORE. CORE\u2019s first final report was released on March 26, 2024. The report concluded that Uyghur forced labour was used at the Hatu gold mine in China, which is primarily owned by a Canadian mining company, and recommended that trade measures be applied against the company.54 Recently, after studying the environmental and human rights considerations regarding foreign operations of Canadian mining and mining exploration firms, a Report of the Standing Committee on International Trade recommended that the Government of Canada explore options to expand the mandate of the CORE. Witnesses who appeared before the Standing Committee in relation to the Report called for CORE to be given the authority to compel witnesses and documents.55 Finally, directors and officers in corporations incorporated under the CBCA may face increased pressure from investors and other stakeholders to consider ESG factors in exercising their powers and discharging their duties on behalf of the corporation. In 2019, Parliament enacted s. 122(1.1) of the CBCA which codified that directors and officers were permitted to consider the interests of various stakeholders, the environment, and the long-term interests of the corporation when acting with a view to the best interests of the corporation. These amendments codify some of the principles relating to directors\u2019 duties set out in BCE Inc. v. 1976 Debentureholders.56 While the factors in s. 122(1.1) may not be mandatory, directors and officers may need to consider taking these factors into account when exercising their fiduciary duties or risk allegations they have breached those duties. As well, these factors could also be relied on to defend against claims that directors and officers did not act in the company\u2019s best interests by adopting ESG measures. Subsection 122(1.1) of the CBCA may represent a stepping stone towards a future statutory duty to consider ESG-related factors, as has occurred for directors in the United Kingdom.57 In the U.K., under the Companies Act 2006, directors must consider, among other things, the interests of the company\u2019s employees, the impact of the company\u2019s operations on the community and the environment, and the need to foster good business practices with suppliers and customers.58 As we can see, the U.K. already requires directors to continually assess ESG issues facing the company. In Canada, some companies may already voluntarily choose to mandate consideration of ESG factors in their operations. Companies that choose to achieve \u201cB Corporation\u201d certification are required to amend their articles to include a requirement that directors consider factors that mirror the ones listed in s. 122(1.1) of the CBCA. Similarly, benefit companies under the British Columbia Business Corporations Act59 must include in their articles a commitment to conduct their business in a \u201cresponsible and sustainable manner\u201d, which is a defined term under the Act. Although \u201cB Corporation\u201d and \u201cbenefit company\u201d statuses are voluntary, they may raise investor expectations for other companies. This trend towards increasing attempts to hold companies liable for their ESG-related performance is likely to continue. Canadian businesses should be prepared to defend their environmental, social, and governance actions, at home and abroad.\n\nEven where ESG-related statements are accurate, they may be used as evidence in litigation about whether a company has fulfilled its legal obligations, or as evidence that a company has run afoul of other legal requirements. For example, in Milieudefensie, discussed above, the Hague District Court referred to Shell\u2019s environmental commitments and public statements as evidence that Shell had not taken sufficient steps to meet its unwritten standard of care under the Dutch Civil Code. In Das v. George Weston Limited, also discussed above, the plaintiffs (unsuccessfully) relied on the company\u2019s voluntarily-adopted Corporate Social Responsibility Standards, incorporated into its Supplier Code of Conduct, to argue that the company should be held responsible for its suppliers\u2019 actions in Bangladesh. More recently, ClientEarth filed a complaint with the US National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines against Cargill. Based on a review of Cargill\u2019s policies and procedures, ClientEarth alleges that Cargill has failed to conduct adequate environmental due diligence. These types of cases serve as a warning that a company\u2019s ESG promises and commitments may be scrutinized by courts when determining whether the company should be held legally responsible for alleged misconduct. Recent case law in Canada and the United Kingdom suggests that public ESG statements may provide a basis for plaintiffs to pierce the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d and sue a parent company directly for the actions of its subsidiaries. If a parent company is sued for the actions of subsidiaries abroad, it should be familiar with the substantive laws of the foreign jurisdiction, which may apply in tort claims brought in Canada. In Choc v. Hudbay Minerals Inc., the plaintiffs alleged that security personnel working for a Canadian parent company\u2019s subsidiaries committed human rights abuses in Guatemala. The parent company had made public statements about its adoption of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights and implementation of these principles for its personnel and contractors in Guatemala. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice considered these public statements, among other factors, to indicate a relationship of proximity between the defendants and the plaintiffs. The case has not been decided on the merits, but the Court allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in negligence to proceed. Two recent decisions by the United Kingdom Supreme Court confirm the trend towards ESG statements as providing some basis for liability of parent companies.60 In Vedanta Resources PLC & Anor v Lungowe & Ors (Vedanta), and Okpabi & Ors v Royal Dutch Shell Plc & Anor (Okpabi), the plaintiffs sued parent companies based in the United Kingdom for the actions of subsidiaries in Zambia and Nigeria, respectively. To connect the defendants to alleged harms abroad, the plaintiffs in each case pointed to published statements and policies of the parent companies. In both Vedanta and Okpabi, the United Kingdom Supreme Court allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims to proceed to trial. The Court held that the liability of parent companies to third parties affected by subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions is to be determined by the ordinary, general principles of tort. A parent company may owe a duty of care to third parties where, in published materials, it holds itself out as exercising a particular degree of supervision and control of its subsidiaries, even if it does not in fact do so. Though neither case has been decided on its merits,61Vedanta and Okpabi opened the door to English courts accepting jurisdiction against English companies in claims relating to environmental harm caused by overseas subsidiaries outside the jurisdiction. For example, Vedanta and Okpabi paved the way for Munic\u00edpio de Mariana v BHP Group Pic, a claim against a parent company, BHP Billiton, in the English courts for approximately \u00a35 billion in damages for its subsidiary allegedly being responsible for the Fund\u00e3o dam collapse in Brazil in 2015.62 That case is set to go to trial in October 2024.63 These cases have piqued the interest of law firms and litigation funders and may encourage similar claims in the English courts and other jurisdictions. In Canada, the Court of Appeal for Ontario has already cited Vendanta and Okpabi in considering potential liability in tort for parent companies.64 However, ESG statements may not only be used to litigate a company\u2019s perceived failure to uphold ESG commitments. In November 2022, five U.S. senators wrote to 51 law firms explaining that pursuing ESG initiatives might result in antitrust violations. In particular, the letters highlighted that ESG group initiatives, to the extent that they can affect competition, are relevant to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Law firms were cautioned that \u201cCongress will increasingly use its oversight powers to scrutinize the institutionalized antitrust violations being committed in the name of ESG\u201d and warned to \u201cpreserve relevant documents\u201d in anticipation of FTC and Department of Justice investigations. Canadian businesses should be aware of this political backlash in the U.S., as such sentiments could migrate into Canada, and should confirm that their ESG initiatives comply with the Competition Act. In light of plaintiffs using companies\u2019 ESG statements and commitments in court in an attempt to base liability for corporate actions or inaction, Canadian businesses should be particularly careful to scrutinize their ESG disclosure to confirm it aligns with their operations and any applicable laws. Similar to the auditing of due diligence programs, an early legal review of ESG disclosure may be beneficial."

            "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: Don Lindsay, CEO of Teck Resources Ltd., in Vancouver on June 23, 2022. Canada\u2019s largest public companies are using ESG goals in their executive compensation plans.JENNIFER GAUTHIER/The Globe and Mail\n\nA growing number of Canada\u2019s largest public companies are using climate or social responsibility goals in their executive compensation plans \u2013 although those that do are giving those metrics minimal weight in pay packages.\n\nChief executives at 100 of the largest Canadian companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange received a median of just under $8.6-million in 2022. But while many shareholders are looking for a stronger link between those paycheques and environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures, it\u2019s unlikely top executives will immediately take a big hit in their pay if their companies fall short.\n\nThe attention to ESG in pay plans marries two trends. Most companies have for years been moving away from human discretion in setting executive pay, instead introducing specific criteria tied to their performance. At the same time, corporations have realized that maximizing shareholder returns may, in the long run, require a greater emphasis on what\u2019s called \u201cstakeholder capitalism\u201d \u2013 that is, the impact a company has on their workers, customers, and citizens of the places they do business.\n\nHow much are Canada\u2019s top CEOs paid? Here\u2019s the full breakdown\n\nA 2022 survey by law firm Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP found 67 per cent of companies in the S&P/TSX 60 Index of large corporations have introduced ESG objectives as part of their top executives\u2019 incentive plans.\n\nAt many companies, however, the ESG goals are opaque: Companies disclose that ESG is part of the \u201cqualitative\u201d evaluation that makes up a minority of an executive\u2019s annual bonus, and offer little more by way of specifics.\n\nSome companies, particularly in energy and mining \u2013 including Suncor Inc. and Teck Resources Ltd. \u2013 are laying out the numbers behind specific goals, or even creating special stock awards that only pay out if climate and sustainability goals are met.\n\nStill, basing one part of just one element of executive compensation on ESG factors means that, even at the companies leading the trend, only a small piece of an executive\u2019s paycheque is based on ESG goals.\n\n\u201cWe do think CEOs should be paid well and fairly for their work \u2013 and that CEO pay should be tied to their performance on relevant performance-based metrics, including the most material ESG risks,\u201d said Anthony Schein, the director of shareholder advocacy at SHARE, a group that assists institutional investors in advocating for social justice matters. But, he adds, there\u2019s currently \u201ca troublesome disconnect between corporate ESG performance, in particular, and CEO and C-suite pay.\u201d\n\nAnd CEO pay remains sizable, despite a recent decrease. The $8.6-million median figure for the 100 largest Canadian companies \u2013 based on an annual Globe and Mail review of executive compensation, in partnership with consulting firm Global Governance Advisors \u2013 is a 1.74-per-cent drop from what those companies paid their CEOs in 2021.\n\nCompensation specialists say there are a couple of reasons for the atypical decline in pay. Annual bonuses were particularly high in 2021 coming out of COVID-19, and settled down in 2022. And many companies\u2019 stock performance underwhelmed in 2022.\n\n\u201cTotal shareholder returns were relatively flat or down a little bit amongst this group of 100 and pay was relatively flat amongst the group \u2013 which doesn\u2019t always turn out that way,\u201d said Peter Landers, a senior partner at Global Governance Advisors. \u201cOverall, we saw more of a measured, conservative approach to pay.\u201d\n\nThe pay decline in 2022 came after two years of pay increases during the pandemic. Median CEO pay rose 1.38 per cent in 2020 and over 23 per cent in 2021 as markets soared.\n\nThe 2022 decline was based on an analysis of pay practices at all 100 companies in the survey, even if they switched CEOs in 2022. At the 83 companies where the same CEO was in the role for two consecutive years, there was a median pay increase of 1.56 per cent.\n\n\u201cI think if we look at the results in 2021, companies were coming out of COVID and perhaps had modest targets and not a lot of certainty \u2013 so bonus payouts were pretty high,\u201d said Marty Beraldo, a senior principal in Mercer\u2019s Canadian executive compensation practice.\n\n\u201cThis year, I think it\u2019s something closer to business as usual or potentially more predictable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe annual bonuses were not as high as last year and that\u2019s likely why we\u2019ve seen a bit of flatter comp this year.\u201d\n\nMany companies set 2021 incentive-plan targets in late 2020, a time of great economic fear related to COVID-19, so the financial targets were modest. For many of those companies, things turned out much better than expected, and they blew through their bonus targets. The boards at a handful of companies used discretion to scale back the windfall payments, but most did not.\n\nAs a result, the number of CEOs who received cash bonuses of $1-million or more in the 100 companies in The Globe\u2019s survey dropped from 82 in 2021 to 73 in 2022. The median bonus fell from $1.95-million to $1.64-million.\n\nBut the median stock-award package \u2013 which includes grants of share units and stock options \u2013 was $4.74-million in 2023, nearly unchanged from $4.77-million in 2022.\n\nVariable pay \u2013 companies like to call it \u201cat-risk\u201d compensation \u2013 makes up the bulk of CEO compensation packages. Base salaries made up just 12 per cent of total compensation last year for the 100 CEOs measured, while annual bonuses made up nearly 20 per cent of pay, and stock awards accounted for nearly 60 per cent.\n\nIt is in these incentive plans where climate and ESG metrics have had a growing presence. At first, many companies placed ESG goals in their short-term incentive plans, despite the long-term nature of many of the business challenges \u2013 climate change, sustainability \u2013 that are consider part of ESG.\n\nA 2019 Compensation Governance Partners survey of disclosures by of 196 companies in the S&P/TSX Composite Index found 61 per cent of the companies measured sustainability metrics in their incentives. The survey found just 3 per cent of companies placed their metrics in their long-term incentive plan, while the rest were included in the annual bonus metrics or other short-term plans.\n\nThe 2022 Fasken survey found the proportion of ESG used in long-term pay plans, versus short-term plans, had risen to 32 per cent, however.\n\n\u201cAs much as we agree that ESG is longer term, when companies start to incorporate ESG measures, they start with annual bonus,\u201d says Victor Li, a governance consultant at Victor ESG Inc. \u201cThey didn\u2019t start with long-term because they didn\u2019t know how it will turn out. It is part of the struggle over quantifying a lot of this, particularly for the companies that are not in resource extraction.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Canadian leaders in introducing quantifiable climate and ESG measures in their long-term pay plans are energy and mining companies.\n\nIn 2022, Suncor created \u201cClimate Performance Share Units,\u201d a type of stock award designed to \u201clink the compensation of our executives to Suncor\u2019s climate-related goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.\u201d The 2022 award, Suncor said, \u201cwill vest based on progress from 2022 through 2024 towards our 2030 commitment to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 10 megatonnes.\u201d\n\nSuncor valued the award of 12,242 CPSUs to then-CEO Mark Little at about $450,000 in the company\u2019s disclosures that year. The company valued all his share and option awards that year at just over $9-million, meaning the climate PSUs represented about 5 per cent of his awards \u2013 and less than 4 per cent of his total $11.8-million in compensation. (The company did not reply to a request for comment.)\n\nIn 2022, Teck Resources introduced a Sustainability Progress Index as part of the metrics for its performance-share plans. The index is split equally among several measures: climate change; biodiversity and reclamation; management of its tailings facilities; equity, diversity and inclusion; and ESG ratings and rankings.\n\nThe Sustainability Index makes up 20 per cent of the weightings for the various metrics in the plan, with other measures such as shareholder return and production costs versus budget accounting for the rest.\n\nIn 2022, then-CEO Don Lindsay received a share award Teck valued at $3.76-million, meaning just over $750,000 of it was based on the sustainability index. Mr. Lindsay made $12.95-million last year, so sustainability-based pay made up just under 6 per cent of his package. Each of the five long-term sustainability measures, including climate change, make up about 1.2 per cent of total pay.\n\nIn an e-mail, Teck spokesperson Dale Steeves noted the company\u2019s annual bonus program has included health and safety and sustainability factors \u201cfor years.\u201d He said Teck\u2019s health and safety performance can increase or decrease the corporate-performance rating portion of the annual incentive by 10 per cent. Sustainability performance makes up a portion of the business unit ranking, which was worth 6 per cent of the CEO\u2019s annual incentive award in 2022, Mr. Steeves added.\n\nKen Hugessen, a Toronto compensation consultant, said of CEO compensation: \u201cThe majority of plans are a little bit \u2018walk before you run,\u2019 both in terms of proportion of incentive at risk based on those measures, but also on measurement ... It is a gradual process, coming up with objectively measurable milestones and measures to replace judgments about whether you\u2019re moving ahead or backward. But it is happening, and the weight is going up.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Huggessen said, \u201cat least as far as I can see, it will be a long time before the weighting of ESG will come anywhere close to the weighting of good old-fashioned things like earnings and return on equity. Quite possibly never \u2013 and quite possibly, appropriately, never.\u201d\n\nRyan Resch, a partner at compensation consulting firm Southlea Group, said there may be a limit from a governance perspective as to how many companies need to be putting environment or climate into their incentive plan.\n\n\u201cFor a company that does not have its own meaningful climate footprint, if a tiny reduction in climate impact creates any sizable financial reward to the executives, it could be out of proportion,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhereas a Suncor, it\u2019s not as easy to get there and it\u2019s going to have a much more material impact on the business.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr. Schein of SHARE said as soon as next year \u201cthere will be more connection between ESG performance and pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvestors that we talked to in Canada, and also globally, are putting more of an emphasis there,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of investors are looking for accountability for lack of action on climate transition.\u201d\n\nWho were Canada\u2019s best-paid CEOs in 2022?\n\nTop-paid CEOs, total compensation, in millions of dollars\n\nSeetarama Kotagiri, Magna International Inc., $36.41\n\nTony Staffieri, Rogers Communications Inc., $31.52\n\nTobias L\u00fctke, Shopify Inc., $26.03\n\nJos\u00e9 Cil, Restaurant Brands International Inc., $22.2\n\nMark Barrenechea, OpenText Corp., $20.11\n\nDarren Entwistle, TELUS Corp., $17.49\n\nMark Bristow, Barrick Gold Corp., $17.39\n\nBrad Corson, Imperial Oil Ltd., $17.34\n\nAl Monaco, Enbridge Inc., $17.23\n\nRoy Gori, Manulife Financial Corp., $17.08\n\nBiggest bonuses (millions of dollars)\n\nPatrick Dovigi, GFL Environmental Inc., $8.77\n\nAlain B\u00e9dard, TFI International Inc., $5.94\n\nMark Bristow, Barrick Gold Corp., $5.27\n\nJay Hennick, Colliers International Group Inc., $5.01\n\nHighest total stock awards (millions of dollars)\n\nSeetarama Kotagiri, Magna International Inc., $31.50\n\nTobias L\u00fctke, Shopify Inc., $26.03\n\nJos\u00e9 Cil, Restaurant Brands International Inc., $17.67\n\nTony Staffieri, Rogers Communications Inc., $16.75\n\nMark Barrenechea, OpenText Corp., $15.29\n\nBiggest CEO share ownership stakes (billions of dollars)\n\nGalen Weston, George Weston Ltd., $13.21\n\nTobias L\u00fctke, Shopify Inc., $3.74\n\nBruce Flatt, Brookfield Corp., $2.88\n\nPierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau, Quebecor Inc., $2.14\n\nPrem Watsa, Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., $1.88\n\nMichael Rose, Tourmaline Oil Corp., $1.13\n\nBiggest accrued pension obligation (millions of dollars)\n\nJeffrey Orr, Power Corporation of Canada, $33.58\n\nNancy Southern, Canadian Utilities Ltd., $27.87\n\nDarren Entwistle, TELUS Corp., $26.10\n\nAl Monaco, Enbridge Inc., $25.50\n\nPaul Mahon, Great-West Lifeco Inc., $23.32\n\nMost valuable unexercised stock options (millions of dollars)\n\nKeith Creel, Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd., $135.56\n\nDon Lindsay, Teck Resources Ltd., $117.14\n\nAlain B\u00e9dard, TFI International Inc., $71.56\n\nBrian Hannasch, Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., $66.41\n\nTim McKay, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., $57.24\n\nAlexander Pourbaix, Cenovus Energy Inc., $51.70\n\nSource: Global Governance Advisors research based on company filings"
