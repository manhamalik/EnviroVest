            "search_summary": "Green Google: Are Tech Brands the Sustainable Superheroes of the 21st Century?\u00a0\u00a0Impakter",
            "article_text": "Encompassing all aspects of online daily life, Google offers everything from email, maps, domotics, transportation and Google Meet to Google Drive for cloud storage of files. The array of services offered by the tech giant have been essential, especially over the last 12 months of Covid-lockdowns. In September 2020, Google announced that it had offset all carbon emissions since the formation of the company in 1998.\n\nIn October, only a month later, the company pledged to make all packaging for hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. Given Google\u2019s recent sustainability achievements, it is not unreasonable to suggest they will meet their packaging commitment.\n\nThat said, in the past, the company has made \u201csubstantial\u201d contributions to some notorious climate deniers, such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). This leads us to question, where does Google truly lie in terms of sustainability and climate activism?\n\nTo answer the question, I turned to the Impakter Index, a reliable reference for evaluating the sustainability of brands as the Index is the product of a team of experts that work to uncover all the available data \u2013 from sustainability certificates to news reports \u2013 in order to arrive at a trustworthy rating. And the Impakter Index has given Google a B rating, meaning Google is considered \u201cgood\u201d on the front of sustainability and the analyst outlook is positive. In taking a deeper look at the company\u2019s policies, we will explore why Google was given this rating.\n\nDespite some of the questionable investment choices made in the past by Google, their recent commitment and goals are indicative of positive change towards a \u201cgreener\u201d future.\n\nTech brands, including Google, dominated the business rankings in 2020. In part, this was due to the pandemic, and the shift in working and socialising online. In 2020, YouGov placed Google at the top of the table for Best Global Brand for the fourth year in a row, beating the likes of Youtube, Amazon and Netflix. The ranking is determined using each brand\u2019s Index score, which is calculated using the public\u2019s perception of the brand, assessing the overall \u201cbrand health.\u201d\n\nIn May 2021, Lightspeed, a provider of cloud-based, omnichannel commerce platforms, announced the integration of Google tools directly into its platform. As independent businesses embark on their journey of returning to \u201cnormality,\u201d safely re-opening after a year, this integration will allow independent retailers to manage Google tools directly in the Lightspeed commerce platform.\n\nNew data from Google has suggested that consumers are interested in shopping locally, but due to the pandemic, many still prefer to shop online. In the past year, online searches for \u201clocal\u201d + \u201cbusiness(es)\u201d have increased by more than 80% year over year.\n\nThis global partnership between Lightspeed and Google incorporates three essential tools directly into the Lightspeed platform: Google Local Inventory Ads, Google Smart Shopping Campaigns, and Google My Business. For omnichannel retailers, who use a multichannel approach to provide a smooth customer experience online or in a physical store, this integration is highly convenient.\n\nThe influence Google holds over every single aspect of our daily lives is ever more evident. The corporation has the power to reach almost every single person on the planet, which makes the question of how they use their platform to promote sustainability and environmental activism all the more pressing.\n\nAccording to the report of the Impakter Index team, Google believes \u201ctechnology can be used to help address the biggest issues facing humanity\u201d.\n\nGoogle has committed to \u2018climate action\u2019 (SDG13), by matching 100% of the electricity consumption of its global operations with renewable energy (SDG7).\n\nFurthermore, Google invests in artificial intelligence, particularly in the role it could play in aiding the company to achieve greater energy efficiency gains in their data centers; and it invests in prioritising the use of safe materials and chemistry across Google\u2019s built spaces.\n\nOther impressive achievements include:\n\nBy the end of 2018, Google Nest Thermostats have helped customers cumulatively save more than 29 billion kWh of energy.\n\nThrough Google.org , they\u2019ve awarded millions of dollars in grants to promising water-conservation solutions.\n\nBy using Google shuttles in the Bay Area , they saved 40,000 tons CO2 e emissions \u2014 equivalent to taking 8,760 cars off the road every workday.\n\nGoogle Maps provides more than 1 billion kilometers\u2019 (621 million miles\u2019) worth of transit results per day, helping limit carbon emissions by giving people access to mass transit options, bike routes, and traffic information.\n\nSince 2015 , Project Sunroof has mapped more than 107 million rooftops in 21,500 cities across Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nBy the end of 2018, Project Air View had captured more than 475 million cumulative air quality measurements in 62 cities worldwide.\n\nEarth Engine has enabled tens of thousands of active users around the world to easily analyse 20 petabytes of geospatial information, resulting in a deeper understanding of the planet.\n\nIn addition to the numerous targets, projects and progress made by Google, they also invest in schemes aimed at giving back to communities, through education, employment opportunities, as well as aiding lower GDP countries.\n\nMoreover, Google is the first cloud company that has announced that they will not abuse their technology to create customized algorithms for the oil and gas industry. They\u2019ve also been acknowledged for their work, receiving praise from large environmental organizations for their actions, including Greenpeace.\n\nHowever, there is some criticism of the information published by the company as it appears to contrast with what they actually deliver. Every year, Google publishes a diversity report. Their most recent 2020 report claimed that they \u201cwork hard on improving diversity and inclusion,\u201d however in reality, only 32% of their global employees are women.\n\nFurthermore, every year they launch a new Pixel phone, encouraging consumers to upgrade their devices in favour of the newest technology, thus contributing towards a throw away consumerist culture.\n\nPerhaps these seem minor in comparison to the figures and impressive projects backed by the company, however, they are worth noting given their declared commitments towards sustainability.\n\nSo, how sustainable is this tech giant?\n\nThe company has made progress and the Impakter Index team has taken care to clearly identify it. On July 27, 2015, as part of the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, Google committed to tripling its purchases of renewable energy from 1.1 GW to 3.4 GW by 2025. By the end of 2018, Google had signed 34 agreements totalling more than 3.75 GW of renewable energy, exceeding their target seven years early. Impressive.\n\nThe Impakter Index team reviewed in detail Google\u2019s awards and certificates and examined company activity in relation to each relevant United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (see the section \u201cUN SDG Compliance\u201d that covers SDG#3, #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15.)\n\nThe conclusion potentially reveals the nature of Google\u2019s sustainability policies. In its evaluation report, the Impakter Index team concludes:\n\n\u201cGoogle has received a few awards, is listed in Forbes, and has certificates (ISO 50001, LEED). They are quite compliant with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, cooperating with numerous NGOs, providing finances and implementing their own sustainable policies.\n\nGoogle emphasizes the usage of technology for a better world and they try to minimize their carbon footprint. They are the first cloud company that announced that they would not create customized algorithms for the oil and gas industry. Google has received praise from several large-scale environment organisations, including Greenpeace.\u201d\n\nThe company is rated as \u201cB\u201d for their effort to protect our planet. And it earns brownie points on transparency: Google\u2019s environment and diversity reports are easily accessible and clearly state the progress made within the company. The goals they have set for the coming years are judged to be direct-on-target and are already being achieved ahead of schedule.\n\nFinally, Google reports the carbon impact of its activities through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) which has consistently given Google an A and a rating of 99 for participation. CDP is a not-for-profit charity that runs a global disclosure system for investors, companies, and cities, managing their environmental impacts. Important to note is that CDP is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d of environmental reporting. This certifies the good work done by Google.\n\nHere is the CDP rating for 2020 (screenshot):\n\nIt would appear Google is an inspiration for many other global brands, achieving positive environmental policies while remaining hugely influential and relevant.\n\nSo why is Google not getting an A on the Impakter Index? To improve beyond the B rating, the Impakter Index team suggests that Google should aim to acquire more certificates, as well as aligning their future goals more closely to the SDGs. Will they make it? They\u2019ve shown their commitment so far and there\u2019s every reason to believe that, yes, Google will make it."

            "article_text": "Plan A, a carbon accounting and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) reporting platform for corporations, has raised $27 million in a Series A round of funding led by U.S. VC giant Lightspeed Venture partners.\n\nTechnically the funding is an extension of a $10 million Series A round it announced nearly two years ago, meaning for all intents and purposes this is the closing of a $37 million Series A round, taking its total raised to $42 million across its six year history. But perhaps more notably, its latest round also includes participation from some major names from the corporate world, including Visa, Deutsche Bank, and BNP Paribas\u2019 VC arm Opera Tech Ventures, among numerous other angel investors.\n\n\u201cThe urgency of the climate crisis, combined with the complexity of navigating net-zero journeys for businesses, made it imperative for us to bring onboard top-tier investors now,\u201d Lubomila Jordanova, Plan A founder and CEO, explained to TechCrunch.\n\nScoping out\n\nFounded out of Berlin in 2017, Plan A (a reference to the \u2018no plan B\u2019 climate action mantra) is one of numerous VC-backed startups to emerge out of Europe with the express aim of helping companies measure (and cut) their carbon footprint. The perennial problem, it seems, is that even with the best will in the world, cutting carbon emissions can be difficult unless a company makes a real effort to discover exactly what their emissions are, and where they are in the supply chain.\n\nA survey last year from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that 90% of organizations didn\u2019t measure their greenhouse gas emissions \u201ccomprehensively.\u201d As usual, so-called \u201cscope 3 emissions\u201d were identified as a major stumbling block, whereby a company fails to address emissions down through its supply chain involving partner businesses. While it\u2019s true that scope 3s are more difficult to measure compared to scope 1 (which refers to emissions directly under a company\u2019s control), there is growing pressure for organizations to address emissions throughout their network.\n\nThis is important for a number of reasons, but mainly because many businesses\u2019 carbon footprint is largely made up of scope 3 emissions. For example, a Coca-Cola bottling partner \u2014 Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP) \u2014 has previously estimated that 93% of its emissions were scope 3.\n\nMoreover, rather than coming down, global energy-related Co2 emissions are still on the rise, growing 0.9 percent in 2022.\n\n\u201cAs the climate crisis is defined in large part by the growth of emissions, one of the most urgent challenges, and the only economically viable choice, is to rapidly reduce the emissions curve, especially for companies,\u201d Jordanova said.\n\nThus, Plan A has developed a SaaS-based sustainability platform that enables companies to self-manage their net-zero efforts \u2014 this includes collecting data, calculating emissions, setting targets, and decarbonization planning. Crucially, it includes mapping emissions data across all scope 1, 2, and 3, and aligning them with global scientific standards and methodologies, including the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).\n\nWhile the core Plan A product is a web app, customers \u2014 which include BMW, Deutsche Bank, KFC, and Visa \u2014 can also plug directly into Plan A via API, which is useful for integrating business and emissions data from across myriad applications such as business travel software and business intelligence (BI) tools.\n\nToday, Plan A counts 120 employees across Berlin, Paris, and London, and with its fresh cash injection Jordanova said that it plans to \u201cdouble down\u201d on that with a slew of new hires.\n\n\u201cThe funding now heralds our next growth phase,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the fresh capital, we will double our headcount to expand our market penetration in Europe with a strong focus on France, the U.K., and Scandinavia, as well as deepen our platform capabilities.\u201d\n\nClimate emergency\n\nWhile the funding landscape is somewhat arid these days beyond a swath of seed stage rounds, climate-tech startups seem to have fared relatively well, though overall funding in the space is still down on last year. The data suggests this is largely due to a decline in later-stage funding from Series B onwards, with early-stage trends looking a little better.\n\nHowever, ESG data startups in particular seem to be in demand. Climate data startup Persefoni last month announced $50 million in fresh funding, which follows two other European rivals Sweep and Greenly which raised $73 million and $23 million respectively, albeit last year. Elsewhere, ESG data management startup Novisto secured $20 million in Series B funding a few months back.\n\nWhile funding across the startup sphere is down, it still seems that investors still view climate tech more favorably compared to many other sectors, with the overall share of VC dollars growing from 10% to 13% in the past year, according to Dealroom data. And this, according to Jordanova, is down to several factors. While other industries have suffered due to macroeconomic factors and shifting investor preferences, climate tech is thriving (relatively) due in large part to the severity of the accelerating climate emergency which is leading to more regulation and pressure being heaped on enterprises to change course before it\u2019s too late.\n\n\u201cEuropean governments have implemented policies and regulations favouring clean tech, offering incentives and subsidies to attract investors,\u201d Jordanova said. \u201cLarge corporations are also making sustainability commitments, driving investments in startups that align with their goals.\u201d\n\nLightspeed\u2019s London partner Julie Kainz said that climate will \u201clikely be one of the most attractive investment themes\u201d in the coming decades. \u201cSolving the climate challenge has firmly moved on the strategic agenda of governments, corporations and the general public; and we strongly believe that the pressure from consumers will only continue to rise,\u201d Kainz told TechCrunch by email."

            "article_text": "Teck Resources Ltd. TECK-B-T and its controlling shareholder, the Vancouver-based Keevil family, have spent the past five years trying to make the global miner more palatable to investors who are concerned with environmental, social and governance principles \u2013 a campaign that culminated Tuesday with the decision to spin out Teck\u2019s steelmaking coal business into a new publicly traded company.\n\nYet on the very same day, Teck also announced plans to buy out its controlling shareholders, including the Keevils, for $309-million. The family members currently control Teck through their class A shares that each have 100 votes, while widely held Teck class B shares each have one vote. As part of the sunset agreement, all class A shares will convert after six years, and all controlling shareholders will receive one class B share, plus a premium of 0.67 of a class B share, for each class A share they own.\n\nA majority of class B shareholders must approve these terms, as well as the coal spinout, at Teck\u2019s annual meeting this spring. If approved, the class B shares awarded as a buyout premium will be given to the controlling shareholders this year.\n\nPaying such a hefty premium \u2013 or any premium at all \u2013 to end a dual-class structure is widely frowned upon by governance experts, and in recent years a growing number of founders and founding families have relinquished control of the companies they created for no extra money, including at Alimentation Couche-Tard ATD-T and Lightspeed Commerce LSPD-T.\n\nHowever, any debate on the ethics of control premiums is spirited in Canada because so many dominant, publicly listed companies are still controlled by their founding families. At the start of the year, 102 companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange had dual-class shares, according to TMX Group, and they run the gamut of sectors \u2013 from consumer goods (Canadian Tire CTC-A-T), to financial services (the Power Corp. POW-T family of companies), to telecom (Rogers Communications Ltd. RCI-B-T).\n\nThere have also been significant precedents in which controlling families were paid huge sums in order to give up control. In 2010, Magna International MG-T paid founder Frank Stronach $860-million in 2010 in return for his class B shares, and in 2012 BCE paid Astral Media\u2019s founding family, the Greenbergs, more per share than common shareholders as part of its takeover, and also paid cash for a third class of shares that the Greenbergs also exclusively owned.\n\nThose payouts, however, are now more than a decade old, and in the years since the practice has been routinely criticized by governance experts.\n\nPublic investors have also embraced ESG principles over this time period, and doing so has forced commodity producers to reconsider the carbon footprints. But in an interview, Catherine McCall, the executive director of the Canadian Coalition for Good Governance, stressed that the environment is only one tenet of the movement, and if anything, good governance is its bedrock.\n\n\u201cGovernance is foundational,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get anywhere with E and S without good governance structures in place.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of dual-class shares, investors have even revolted at times. In 2016, retail giant Alimentation Couche-Tard\u2019s four founders sought to extend their control of the company, which was set to expire when the youngest of them turned 65, but the company cancelled a shareholder vote on the proposal after concluding that it did not have the two-thirds support needed.\n\nFounder Alain Bouchard took the rejection personally, but ultimately gave up the campaign in 2020, and in 2021, the 25-year-old special stock rights expired with no extension or compensation to the founders.\n\nIt is now commonplace for controlling shares to convert to common stock for no premium. In 2020, for instance, Dax Dasilva, the founder of Montreal payments company Lightspeed Commerce, relinquished his multiple voting shares for no premium because Lightspeed had a clause in its shareholder agreement that stipulated the special voting shares would automatically convert to common shares once the company had grown to a certain size and a certain amount of common shares had been issued.\n\nAlthough governance experts deride control premiums, they typically appreciate that the issue of dual-class shares is nuanced. Founders tend to want to keep control in order to focus on long-term investment decisions.\n\nIn Teck\u2019s case, that logic applies.\n\nThe Keevils planted the earliest seeds of the Teck Resources empire in the 1950s by discovering a high-grade copper mine around their family cottage near Lake Temagami, close to North Bay, and over the years they merged their assets with other companies and endured many economic swings. The 1981 recession nearly bankrupted the miner, but they found a way to restructure its operations to survive. The Keevils also invested in the Antamina copper project around 2000 when metals were extremely cheap, which prompted many investors to abandon Teck\u2019s shares for years. Ultimately, though, the project paid off.\n\nThat said, governance groups believe there should be a limit to how long a founding family can control a company, because quite often their power remains entrenched even though they have passed off a majority of the financial risk to public owners. Teck\u2019s dual-class share structure has been in place since a 1969 corporate reorganization.\n\nAsked about the decision to collapse the dual-class share structure, Teck chief executive officer Jonathan Price said in an interview that it all began when the miner\u2019s board of directors and management decided Elk Valley Resources Ltd., the new publicly listed company that will hold the coal assets, would have a single share class structure.\n\n\u201cThat decision,\u201d he said, \u201copened the door to a conversation between the board\u2019s special committee and owners of Teck\u2019s class A shares on modernizing and simplifying the company\u2019s governance.\u201d\n\nWith reports from Andrew Willis and Nicolas Van Praet"

            "article_text": "\"While we appreciate the government's emphasis on green growth and sustainable development, the interim budget falls short of addressing the urgent needs of the sustainability and climate solutions industry. No clear budget allocation for green growth was provided. Although viability gap funding was discussed for harnessing shore and wind energy, there was no mention of specific funds allocated for this purpose. Similarly, while the expansion of the Electrical Vehicle Sector by investing in charging infrastructure is a positive step, there was no clarity on the allocation of funds. Additionally, although the announcement of enabling 1 crore households to obtain up to 300 units of free electricity through rooftop solarisation is commendable and serves as a transition to green energy, the budget did not specify how this initiative will be funded. Furthermore, while initiatives like importing natural gas, methane, and ammonia to reduce emissions are mentioned, there is a lack of clarity on the budget allocation for these measures. Key expectations, such as introducing input tax credits for green fuel usage, providing subsidised loans for green technologies, and incentivizing traceability initiatives, remain unmet. As we look towards the full budget in July 2024, we urge the government to consider these crucial demands to accelerate India's transition towards decarbonisation and create a more sustainable future for all.\u201d"

            "article_text": "Is it just us, or has this winter felt interminable, with the war in Ukraine, soaring prices and economic uncertainty adding to the existential angst we\u2019re all blundering through thanks to the pandemic, the spectre of climate change, income inequality and more? Consider our third annual Changemakers list a bit of much-needed sunlight in an otherwise gloomy season.\n\nOnce again, we put out the call for nominations both from the business community and from across The Globe and Mail. Finalists were evaluated based on their ideas, accomplishments and impact. Out of hundreds of submissions, we narrowed it down to 50 activists, executives, entrepreneurs and academics whose single-minded devotion to making the world a better place for everyone should be an inspiration to us all.\n\nLise Birikundavyi | Managing Partner and Co-founder, BKR Capital\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: TAIWO AINA/The Globe and Mail\n\nLise Birikundavyi was just 20 when Muhammad Yunus won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his novel use of micro-loans to help underprivileged people start businesses and escape poverty. But it was a defining moment for the Burundi-born, Montreal-raised student, then in the trilingual business admin program at HEC Montr\u00e9al. \u201cI became really interested in social entrepreneurship from a financial perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cThat mindset of creating social change but also earning revenue-\u2014because then it becomes more sustainable.\u201d\n\nBirikundavyi went on to obtain an MBA from the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, where she wrote her thesis on impact investing, and later worked as an impact-investment manager in the Ivory Coast with a focus on improving access to quality education in rural communities. In 2020, however, after returning to Canada and having her second child, she was drawn to the idea of using capital markets to level the playing field here at home. \u201cWhen the George Floyd murder happened, I thought about how I could contribute to the movement to make sure the table is big enough for everyone,\u201d says Birikundavyi, now 36. Her solution, along with business partner Isaac Olowolafe, was to create BKR Capital, a $20-million venture capital fund that invests in tech startups founded by Black entrepreneurs.\n\nWith anchor investments from Business Development Canada and RBC, the Toronto-based fund is the first of its kind in the country, creating opportunities for a talented group of innovators who often face challenges accessing capital in a largely white VC space. Those financing roadblocks could be a result of unconscious bias by investors or simply a lack of understanding for disruptive companies answering the unmet needs of minority communities.\n\nTake Calgary-based fintech mIQ, one of five companies in BKR\u2019s growing portfolio. It helps new Canadians build their credit history by reporting payments they make to a lending circle\u2014a group of people who pool funds to access interest-free loans. While lending circles are a common financial tool in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, the concept is new here in Canada. \u201cI\u2019d met different VC and angel investors, and until BKR, it was always a no,\u201d says mIQ co-founder Jonah Chininga, who had difficulty accessing credit and building a credit history himself after emigrating from Zimbabwe in 2014. \u201cThey didn\u2019t live the problem, didn\u2019t know the context, so they couldn\u2019t understand the market opportunity or see the business viability.\u201d\n\nBirikundavyi did. Not only did she give mIQ its first yes, but she also provided Chininga and his co-founders with the knowledge and network to pitch other investors successfully. The company has raised $1.4 million from six backers, including BKR, and has signed on Visa and Equifax as partners, with plans to launch an app this spring.\n\nWith no shortage of promising, underrepresented founders in the tech space\u2014BKR says it has received more than 520 pitch decks since its creation in June 2021\u2014Birikundavyi only wishes there were more opportunities for Black entrepreneurs to access financing.\n\n\u201cWhen pitching us, some founders have said it was their first time speaking to investors who looked like them, and they became quite emotional about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the position that puts us in.\u201d /Tamar Satov\n\nGautam Bakshi | Founder, 15Rock\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Nelson Huang/The Globe and Mail\n\nThe economic risks of climate change can seem abstract for major financial players with bottom lines to look out for. With 15Rock, a risk analytics company he founded in 2019, Gautam Bakshi is on a mission to change that. For two decades before starting 15Rock, Bakshi worked in risk evaluation for financial institutions like TD Bank and Manulife. All the years of thinking about risk from a technical perspective set him up to tackle an underserved market: investors who need someone to boil down the risk of climate inaction into terms they\u2019re comfortable working with.\n\n15Rock uses machine learning and industry-leading financial modelling to spell out the financial consequences of climate risk for investors looking to green their portfolios. Instead of assigning a score to a given portfolio using black-box technology, Bakshi\u2019s firm articulates risk in terms of dollars and cents\u2014and transparently lays out the criteria it uses to do so. For instance, a given billion-dollar portfolio might have $50 million of built-in climate risk that can be mitigated by reallocating investments to less risky companies (or engaging with risky ones to get them to consider shifting strategies). \u201cWe try to speak investors\u2019 language,\u201d says Bakshi. \u201cMost firms don\u2019t have teams focused on climate change, but every company has someone managing the budget.\u201d\n\nRight now, 15Rock works primarily with investors to mitigate the climate risks associated with their portfolios, but Bakshi hopes to expand his offerings to help guide corporations toward climate-friendly decisions internally. \u201cBy articulating climate risk in monetary terms, all of a sudden a company has a financial case for deciding what kinds of vehicles to use in their factories or what types of heat pumps to use, for instance,\u201d he says.\n\nThe work is far from simple\u2014not every climate-friendly decision is economically viable. But by translating the nebulous concept of climate change into concrete terms, Bakshi hopes his tech will help lay the groundwork for environmentally conscious decisions\u2014even if they\u2019re not immediately possible. \u201cWhen people see a big problem that\u2019s not solved yet and has major financial consequences, that sparks innovation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt helps people understand the scope of the opportunities to solve them.\u201d /Liza Agrba\n\nLindsay Lorusso | Co-founder and CEO, Nudnik\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Bre Elbourn/The Globe and Mail\n\nLet this sink in: Due in part to the rise of fast fashion, there\u2019s now enough pre-consumer textile waste (otherwise known as factory waste) to clothe the world\u2019s entire population two times over. But upcycling textile scraps, which normally end up in landfills, can be prohibitively time- and labour-intensive, given the inherent headache of making consistent products out of unpredictable raw materials. Lindsay Lorusso, who worked in waste management for 15 years before she set her sights on the garment sector, teamed up with her twin sister, Alexandra, in 2016 to found Nudnik, a fashion line based on 100% upcycled scraps.\n\nWhy focus on upcycled and not recycled textiles? \u201cUpcycling is far less wasteful, since it uses waste as is, rather than adding water and energy to the equation to process waste into something new,\u201d says Lorusso. In terms of carbon cost, upcycled textiles beat out even more common environmentally friendly options like organic cotton. \u201cTextiles are a challenging material to upcycle, but we saw that as an opportunity,\u201d she says. Leveraging their connections from the waste-management industry, the Lorusso twins teamed up with factory partners overseas and got to work.\n\nInitially, Nudnik would receive a batch of waste from its partners and\u2014based on colour, fabric type and volume\u2014manually come up with styles, a process that could take weeks. Now, the company\u2019s secret sauce is specialized software, finalized six months ago, that cuts the timeline from raw inventory to production-ready collection from weeks to minutes. Doubling as an inventory-management tool and design aid, the tech helps Nudnik make consistent, replicable designs suitable for larger-scale production.\n\nIn 2018, Lorusso participated in the NEXT Canada\u2019s Next Founders program. \u201cThis is where we were challenged to think about how we can scale our upcycling project,\u201d she says. \u201cOur tech was based off the back of this thinking.\u201d Reza Satchu, the accelerator\u2019s founding chairman, distinctly remembers Lorusso being a star of her cohort. \u201cI often talk about founder-market fit, and Lindsay certainly had that,\u201d he says. \u201cWith her experience in the waste sector, she really found the bull\u2019s-eye around an industry she knew and cared a lot about. I\u2019ve been thrilled, but not surprised, to hear of her success.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding its breakthrough tech, the company also relies on a few clever workarounds that make it easier to deal with scraps. Nudnik uses a signature patchwork style\u2014often using contrasting panels of bright, solid hues\u2014which makes mismatched fabrics less of a problem. And since smaller items are easier to make from scraps, it has focused exclusively on children\u2019s clothing.\n\nBut the tech has paved the way for an exciting new era for Nudnik\u2014this year, it will expand its product range to include clothes for adults. \u201cI believe waste is the greatest resource of our time,\u201d says Lorusso, \u201cand upcycling is the new recycling.\u201d /LA\n\nDax Dasilva | Founder, Age of Union Alliance\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Oumayma B. Tanfous/The Globe and Mail\n\nOne of Dax Dasilva\u2019s formative experiences as a teenager in Vancouver was joining the logging protests at Clayoquot Sound. \u201cI remember driving through hours and hours of clearcut, seeing these literal moonscapes,\u201d says the 46-year-old founder of Montreal-based tech firm Lightspeed Commerce. \u201cNow I realize how big of an area we were able to protect, and that motivates me.\u201d\n\nSo, when he sold some shares in Lightspeed following the company\u2019s lucrative IPO in 2019, he knew exactly what to do with the proceeds. He founded Age of Union Alliance, a non-profit that supports organizations working to protect the planet\u2019s threatened species and ecosystems. \u201cWhat else would you want to do with your wealth?\u201d says Dasilva, who left his position as CEO of Lightspeed last year (he\u2019s still the chair), in part to focus on Age of Union.\n\nSince the non-profit\u2019s launch in October 2021, Dasilva has allocated $40 million of his own cash to 10 high-impact conservation and restoration projects in Canada, Peru, Trinidad, Indonesia, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo, including $14.5 million to the B.C. Parks Foundation\u2014the largest single donation it\u2019s ever received. That gift will secure key ecosystems in the province, such as the Pitt River Watershed, a 733-acre salmon-river sanctuary in Katzie First Nation territory near Vancouver, and the French Creek Estuary\u2014a 23-acre eagle sanctuary on Vancouver Island.\n\nBut Dasilva isn\u2019t just a guy in a suit writing cheques. He has visited eight of the conservation projects in person to better understand the problems they face, as well as the potential solutions. \u201cOther people would\u2019ve just gone out and created a [philanthropic] association with their name on it,\u201d says Paul Rosolie, a founder and director of Junglekeepers, a grassroots organization that works with Indigenous populations in the Peruvian Amazon to protect the Madre de Dios region\u2014one of the most biodiverse and pristine areas on Earth. \u201cWhat\u2019s beautiful about what Dax is doing is that he\u2019s coming to the conservation organizations that have been working on the ground for a long time and asking us, \u2018What\u2019s the best way I can help?\u2019\u201d\n\nThat help could involve funding\u2014like the US$3.5 million Age of Union has pledged over five years to Junglekeepers, which will allow it to conserve an additional 50,000 acres of rainforest, preventing the destruction of ancient trees and thousands of species. But it could also come in the form of strategic, legal or technical support, or guidance on how to best tell their story\u2014which can help attract additional funding. Indeed, Age of Union has already produced four documentaries to raise awareness about various projects, and Dasilva spoke at the COP15 biodiversity conference this past December.\n\n\u201cWhen Dax says he wants to solve a problem, it\u2019s not lip service,\u201d says Chelsea Finnemore, who worked with Dasilva for more than a decade at Lightspeed and is now Age of Union\u2019s executive advisor of strategy and operations. \u201cBut no one group or project is going to solve this, so we\u2019re looking at how we can expand the impact beyond leveraging his resources.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Dasilva wants Age of Union to develop a transparent reporting platform that appeals to other philanthropic leaders. \u201cIf we can give businesspeople a real-time dashboard of results, they may feel more comfortable donating,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to show people what\u2019s possible and that there\u2019s hope for change.\u201d /TS\n\nJosh Domingues | Founder and CEO, Flashfood\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Anne-Marie Cloutier/The Globe and Mail\n\nA digital tool that lets consumers buy meat, dairy, produce and other grocery items nearing their best-before date at a discount sounds like something retailers would gobble up. Customers save money, grocers sell stock they\u2019d otherwise toss, and food waste is diverted from landfills, thereby reducing harmful methane emissions\u2014an all-around win. But when Josh Domingues started shopping around his Flashfood app in 2017, that\u2019s not how it played out.\n\n\u201cSelling it to grocers was a challenge,\u201d says Domingues, 34, given that retailers often accepted food waste as a cost of doing business, not a problem to solve. \u201cIt took a while to get in front of the right people and partner with the chains.\u201d But he kept knocking on doors and making connections, ultimately convincing Loblaw to be the company\u2019s first major partner in Canada in 2018.\n\nThat talent for building relationships and gaining trust is Domingues\u2019s superpower, says Flashfood chief product officer Cedric Samaha, a skill he noticed in his colleague in 2015, when the pair first worked together at a Toronto-area management consulting firm. \u201cJosh has a real ability to disarm and relate to people,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen he talks to grocers, it\u2019s not just a cheesy sales pitch.\u201d\n\nNicholas Bertram, former president of northeastern U.S. grocery company Giant, agrees Domingues\u2019s authenticity sets him apart. \u201cJosh was interested in what we could do together, rather than what I could do for him,\u201d he says. \u201cHe genuinely wants to lower food waste and increase access to fresh food for disadvantaged people.\u201d After conducting a successful Flashfood pilot in a single regional market in 2019, Giant went for a full-chain rollout at its 192 grocery stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. \u201cThere\u2019s an elegance to it, which is what good innovation usually is,\u201d says Bertram.\n\nFlashfood now operates in more than 1,400 grocery locations throughout the U.S. and Canada, and to date it has diverted more than 50 million pounds of food from landfills, preventing 95 million pounds of CO2-equivalent from reaching the atmosphere\u2014that\u2019s like taking 9,285 gas-powered passenger vehicles off the road for a year. Moreover, the app has saved shoppers more than $120 million\u2014helping thousands of families afford fresh food at a time when rising inflation is making that increasingly difficult.\n\nThis year, Domingues is looking to increase Flashfood\u2019s impact by scaling stateside, as well as adding non-traditional food partners in Canada. \u201cAll I\u2019ll say is that we\u2019re trying to feed your whole family affordably,\u201d he says coyly, \u201cnot just the human members.\u201d /TS\n\nNagwan al-Guneid | Director, Business Renewables Centre-Canada\n\nA non-profit that helps corporations buy solar and wind power directly from Alberta\u2019s renewable energy producers, BRC-Canada set a goal in 2019 to secure two gigawatts worth of deals by 2025. In May, under the direction of Al-Guneid, it hit that target three years ahead of schedule, bringing 4,500 jobs and $3.8 billion in investment to Alberta, while helping to decarbonize its electricity grid. To meet its new target of 10 GW by 2030, BRC-Canada is working to open up markets in other jurisdictions and involve additional sectors. \u201cCement, steel and heavy industry have big electricity loads,\u201d says Al-Guneid, 38. \u201cIf they procure renewable energy, it\u2019ll have an even bigger impact.\u201d\n\nSarah Keyes | CEO, ESG Global Advisors Inc.\n\nWhile studying accounting at McGill University, Keyes had an aha moment that would define her career. \u201cI realized I could change the profession from the inside out.\u201d She has: Not only was Keyes a principal of sustainability at the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada, where she helped translate climate-change issues into the language of finance, but she also designed the first-ever certificate program in climate change for the Institute of Corporate Directors, where she has trained 150 board members. Now the 35-year-old heads up ESG Global Advisors, which has helped more than 110 companies and institutional investors with their ESG practices.\n\nNathan Hall | Founder & CEO, Culture Check\n\nWhen he was named one of Ottawa\u2019s Forty Under 40 in 2020, Hall did what most of us would do: posted the news on LinkedIn. But amid the congratulatory messages he received was a racist comment from a stranger, shocking many of his connections. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t believe someone would say that in a professional setting,\u201d says the 38-year-old. \u201cBut people have been saying these things to me throughout my career.\u201d That led him to create Culture Check, a consultancy that helps organizations build inclusive cultures, as well as a resource that supports racialized communities so they can thrive in the workplace. \u201cSomething that was meant to tear me down did nothing but build me up,\u201d says Hall. \u201cI\u2019m proud of that, and I want to give that experience to others.\u201d\n\nKevin Krausert | Co-founder and CEO, Avatar Innovations\n\nWhen the oil industry collapsed in the mid-2010s, Krausert was at the helm of Beaver Drilling, the Calgary business his grandfather co-founded in 1965. \u201cThe low rig count prompted a lot of conversations about energy transition, climate change and new technologies,\u201d says Krausert, 42. \u201cSo we started an in-house accelerator to build out those skills.\u201d In 2020, he left Beaver to turn the accelerator into a standalone operation where experts could work together to bring clean technologies to market faster. To date, 644 young professionals have participated in Avatar\u2019s program\u2014supported by Cenovus, Enbridge, TC Energy, Suncor and other large energy companies\u2014working on innovative solutions, including carbon-capture catalysts, methane-emission reduction and geothermal.\n\nManuel Rodriguez | Business Development Manager, SKLatam\n\nWhen Rodriguez and his wife arrived in Saskatoon six years ago, they spoke no English and had a tough time navigating the transition to Canadian life. \u201cFor us, even simple things were very difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a business degree and had a high position in Colombia, but after I arrived here it took four months to find work.\u201d So Rodriguez, 45, launched the Latino-Canadian business community network (SKLatam) to help other Spanish-speaking newcomers access settlement services and training, and to provide a way for Latino entrepreneurs to connect with each other and share knowledge.\n\nLael Williams | Director of Materials Research and Innovation, Canada Goose\n\nAs Canada Goose\u2019s head of materials research, Williams oversees multiple teams that work on R&D. But she doesn\u2019t let managerial responsibilities get in the way of what she loves most about her job: hands-on product development. She was integral to the development of Kind Fleece, a sustainable fleece made mainly of bio-based fibres and recycled wool. That innovation is part of Williams\u2019s larger goal to support the outerwear company towards its goal of using 90% environmentally and socially sustainable textiles by 2025.\n\nAlexandre Guindon | Co-founder and General Manager, 2 Degr\u00e9s\n\nGuindon had planned to study humanitarian health and international development until others suggested a degree in finance would likely open more doors for his altruistic goals. They were right: After spending five years in corporate finance at Desjardins, in 2019 he leveraged his knowledge and network to co-found 2 Degr\u00e9s, a Quebec-based incubator for cleantech startups. Public and private partners provide funding, resources and expertise to more than a dozen startups, working on technologies that address everything from decarbonizing domestic water heating to collecting microplastic from beaches. \u201cWe need to work collectively to create concrete sustainable impact,\u201d says Guindon, 33.\n\nShelley Kuipers + Judy Fairburn | Co-CEOs, The51\n\nLast year, 82.6% of U.S. venture capital funding went to companies with male-only founders; just 2% went to all-female teams. \u201cIt\u2019s a largely paternalistic system,\u201d says Kuipers, a 55-year-old entrepreneur. \u201cBy funding overperforming, underinvested entrepreneurs, we\u2019re making the pie bigger.\u201d That\u2019s something The51 is working to change. Its two feminist venture funds have activated $21 million in capital (90% from women investors) to 29 innovative women-led or co-led companies in Canada and the U.S. \u201cThis is an and, not an or,\u201d says Fairburn, 59, a former C-suite executive who also notes that 98% of the world\u2019s capital is deployed through a man\u2019s decision making, citing the book The XX Edge.\n\nKookai Chaimahawong | ESG Partner, UpperStage Capital\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a personal thesis of integrating living with giving,\u201d says 30-year-old Chaimahawong. Indeed, in 2014 the self-described optimist helped launch one of Thailand\u2019s first social enterprises, a platform where businesses accept charitable donations as payment for unsold products or services. Later, she helped the United Nations mobilize public and private sector support for its Sustainable Development Goals. In 2018, while getting her MBA in Vancouver, she joined VC firm Pangaea to develop impact strategies for venture capital investment. Now, she\u2019s working at UpperStage to ensure the firm\u2019s portfolio meets strict impact criteria.\n\nAndrew Lester | Co-founder, Lyric Cycles\n\nA bike is handy for picking up a carton of milk, but a full grocery run usually requires a car. Lester, 46, wants to change that, by getting riders to replace gas-burning car trips with Lyric Cycles\u2019 Squamish, B.C.\u2013made high-performance e-bikes, which can carry up to 200 pounds of cargo and still have enough torque to handle inclines. \u201cIt\u2019s an affordable way for people to get into electrical transportation,\u201d says Lester, \u201cso they can use as little energy as possible to get around.\u201d\n\nChase Edgelow | Co-founder and CEO, EverGen\n\nIt almost sounds too good to be true: a source of energy that can be stored, can be deployed using existing infrastructure and that reduces harmful emissions. But that\u2019s what EverGen\u2019s renewable natural gas (RNG) is. Projects like its Fraser Valley biogas facility convert the methane produced by food scraps and manure into RNG. And because more emissions are captured during production of the gas than are emitted when burned, the cumulative impact is carbon negative. With a target to use 15% renewable products in its pipeline mixture by 2030, utilities like FortisBC are providing 20-year contracts for RNG. \u201cFor newer transition fuels, that certainty on the back end is unique,\u201d says Edgelow, 38.\n\nArati Sharma | Angel Investor and Founding Partner, Backbone Angels\n\nWhen Sharma and her husband, Satish Kanwar, received a windfall in 2015 after Shopify, where they both worked, went public, he began angel investing\u2014and she noticed most of the founders were men. \u201cThat\u2019s when I decided I wanted to back women with big ideas,\u201d says Sharma, 37. She\u2019s invested in more than 50 mainly Canadian startups with women founders through her family office. And Backbone Angels, which she started in 2021 with nine other female Shopify alums, has invested in another 45-plus. \u201cWomen are incredible founders,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is my call to action to ensure investors are looking at diversity.\u201d\n\nDolma Tsundu | CEO & Founder, Flutter Care; Co-founder, CC4SP\n\nAbout one in every 116 births in Canada is a stillbirth, but research shows many of these tragic losses are avoidable. \u201cWe need to educate the public and care providers on how stillbirth can be prevented,\u201d says Tsundu, a certified doula and biomedical engineer. So she created Flutter Care, a free app that allows expectant parents to track fetal movements and note potential red flags so they can seek preventative care. Last year, Tsundu also co-founded the Canadian Collaborative for Stillbirth Prevention, lobbying the government for a national strategy to reduce stillbirths by at least 30% by 2030 and improve support for bereaved families.\n\nDavid Katz | Founder and CEO, Plastic Bank\n\nEvery year, 11 million tonnes of plastic flows into the world\u2019s oceans, harming marine life and destroying vital ecosystems. Katz realized he could help reduce the problem by compensating locals in poor coastline communities for the plastic waste they bring to nearby depots. The material is then melted into pellets, flakes or bales and sold to Plastic Bank\u2019s corporate partners to be made into new bottles or other materials. In 2022 alone, the social enterprise prevented about 30 million kilograms of plastic\u2014the equivalent of 1.5 billion plastic bottles\u2014from reaching the ocean. \u201cNobody is coming to save us,\u201d says Katz, 54. \u201cIt\u2019s just us.\u201d\n\nJustin Abbiss | CEO, MRKTBOX Inc.\n\nAs an environmentalist and former avalanche forecaster in the Yukon, Abbiss long idolized leaders like Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, who helped popularize \u201cB Corp\u201d certification as the social and environmental gold standard. Now, Abbiss has his own certified B Corp in MRKTBOX, a Hamilton-based grocery company that supports small-scale farms, bakers, coffee roasters and other producers. \u201cBuying local is the best thing you can do for your city,\u201d says the 38-year-old entrepreneur. With three stores and an online delivery service, the company put more than $2.5 million back into the Hamilton-area food ecosystem in 2022 alone.\n\nVickram Agarwal | Chief Marketing Officer, Credit Canada\n\nIn a year and a half at Credit Canada, Agarwal has completely rebranded and reimagined the 57-year-old non-profit. \u201cSince the \u201860s, we\u2019ve offered the same single service\u2014credit counselling\u2014to help people get out of debt.\u201d All well and good, but spending has since changed rapidly, and there are more ways to get into debt than ever before. To better help those drowning in debt, Agarwal\u2019s team has grown from one person to 10 and has modernized their financial coaching and education to promote a more holistic notion of financial health. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been talking about financial literacy, but not financial health,\u201d says Agarwal. \u201cWe\u2019re shifting that knowledge to change financial behaviour and see actual results.\u201d\n\nPat Chaisang | Founder and CEO, Isempower\n\nWhen Chaisang moved to Canada from Thailand to get a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013, finding a job was a steep climb. \u201cI didn\u2019t really speak English and was rejected from even minimum-wage jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what a resum\u00e9 was.\u201d In 2021, she channelled her lived experience into a venture called Isempower that now helps more than 20,000 international students find meaningful work. The company provides introductions to industry mentors, tailored educational resources and connections to vetted employers. Higher education is due for disruption, and who better to make waves than a 27-year-old newcomer who knows its pain points inside-out?\n\nApoorv Sinha | Founder and CEO, Carbon Upcycling Technologies\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to reduce carbon emissions; it\u2019s another to convert them into something useful. Carbon Upcycling Technologies\u2014founded by Sinha, a chemical engineer, in 2014\u2014sequesters CO2 from mines and coal plants in industrial byproducts, and is using that process to create an ultradurable cement replacement. Sinha wants to apply the company\u2019s technology to other sectors like mining, steel and agriculture. \u201cOur mission over the next 10 years,\u201d he says, \u201cis to become the most impactful carbon tech company in the world.\u201d\n\nJennie Coleman | President, Equifruit\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why bananas\u2014a fruit that can only be grown in tropical climes\u2014are so much cheaper than locally grown produce, the answer isn\u2019t pretty. Retailers pressure growers to keep prices down, which means they often rely on forced child labour. Montreal-based Equifruit is 100% Fairtrade-certified, which guarantees safe and equitable working conditions, and a sustainable floor price for its partner farmers in South America and Mexico. Longo\u2019s has carried only Equifruit\u2019s bananas since 2021, and Costco stocks them, too. \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to catch people\u2019s attention and inspire them to join us in making change,\u201d says Coleman, 52.\n\nHelle Bank Jorgensen | Founder and CEO, Competent Boards\n\nCorporate directors haven\u2019t traditionally considered ESG initiatives to be under their purview. \u201cThey were pet projects of the CEO, instead of embedded in the business,\u201d says Bank Jorgensen, a 55-year-old Danish lawyer and accountant who created the world\u2019s first so-called green account and the first annual report combining ESG with financial performance. \u201cBut there\u2019s a duty of care for board members, and they need to understand all the aspects of ESG so they can make informed decisions.\u201d To help them get up to speed, she launched Toronto-based Competent Boards in 2018, which has now delivered the online ESG and climate designation programs she developed to more than 600 leaders in 46 countries. Her next goal: to train at least one board member on every Fortune 1000 board by 2025.\n\nLeejoo Hwang | Chief Operating Officer, Co-founder, MeaningfulWork\n\nWhen the COVID-19 lockdowns hit in 2020, Hwang noticed that many non-profits were struggling to transition their activities online. At the same time, he and many others had more time on their hands and wanted to help. So he co-founded MeaningfulWork, a website where organizations can connect with new volunteers ready to give back. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for ways to build communities,\u201d says Hwang, 23, who also started a communal garden near his home in Vancouver.\n\nKayla Isabelle | CEO, Startup Canada\n\nIsabelle took the reins at Startup Canada in 2020. The company, which connects entrepreneurs with resources to grow their businesses, has since tripled its team, expanded its virtual services, grown its reach from 10 to more than 300 cities, and gone from supporting 75,000 entrepreneurs to 140,000-plus. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more inspiring than seeing the ideas entrepreneurs come up with to solve the world\u2019s most pressing challenges,\u201d she says. \u201cThat takes enormous courage, and I see my role as helping them achieve their dreams.\u201d\n\nStarrlee DeGrace | Global D&I Leader for Native and Indigenous Communities, IBM\n\nAfter 15 years in sales at IBM, DeGrace scored a big promotion with an even bigger task: to create safe and inclusive spaces, programs and policies for current and future Indigenous employees. \u201cI\u2019m newly in a position to make a difference,\u201d says DeGrace, a member of the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation. She\u2019s already launched countless networks and initiatives focused on Indigenous youth. In just seven months, she met with and mentored 150-plus young people interested in a career in STEM.\n\nEmma Stern | Co-founder and COO, Felix Health\n\nOne in five Canadians don\u2019t have a family doctor, and amid a nationwide shortage of medical practitioners, private digital providers are helping increase access to basic medications like birth control and acne treatments. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason ER doctors should be filling Viagra prescriptions,\u201d says Stern, co-founder of Felix Health. The company, created in 2019, offers virtual appointments and sends medications to people\u2019s homes. \u201cLowering barriers to health care is our mission,\u201d she says. And while Felix currently charges for online visits, Stern hopes the service will eventually be covered by government.\n\nChris Russell | Energy Engineering Manager, EastPoint Engineering\n\nIt\u2019s not always easy to find common ground between Canada\u2019s climate goals and the people responsible for implementing necessary changes to infrastructure. That\u2019s exactly what Russell, head of energy engineering at Halifax-based EastPoint Engineering, does. Drawing on a combination of technical chops, policy knowledge and people skills, Russell develops climate-friendly retrofitting plans for existing buildings, typically slashing their greenhouse gas output in half and reducing energy costs by up to 30%. \u201cEnvironmental policy is no longer the only driving factor. The technology is there, and the business case is there,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem is usually bringing people up to speed, and that\u2019s where we come in.\u201d\n\nJonathan Edwards | Principal Research Scientist, CERT Systems\n\nThe production of ethylene, a petrochemical used to make plastic, exceeds that of any other organic compound in the world. It\u2019s traditionally made in a carbon-intensive process using fossil fuels, but Edwards is working at Toronto-based CERT Systems to change that. He\u2019s developing a new method to make ethylene using CO2 emissions from, for example, the steel and cement industries. His research is still precommercial, but if it scales as planned, it could beget a titanic shift in the way one of the world\u2019s most ubiquitous chemicals is produced\u2014and substantially lower global greenhouse gas emissions in the process.\n\nMajid Mirza | Co-founder and CEO, ESGTree\n\nThe past couple of years were big ones for ESG investing, from Glasgow\u2019s COP26 to the implementation of the first ESG-related regulation in financial markets (the EU\u2019s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation). ESGTree\u2014a platform for private equity investors helmed by impact-investing veteran Mirza\u2014jumped on the opportunity, enjoying 2.5 times annual growth, while helping investors align their portfolios with environmentally and socially responsible companies. With his private-equity clients managing more than $200 billion in assets, Mirza is determined to prove ESG investing isn\u2019t a fad\u2014it\u2019s a high-impact tool for effecting positive change.\n\nJames Yurichuk | Founder and CEO, Wuxly Movement\n\nBefore he started a fashion company, Yurichuk was a professional football linebacker\u2014albeit one with an entrepreneurial bent. His first foray into clothing was a personal project: making the perfect parka for his then girlfriend (now wife and mother of his four kids). Yurichuk took that $5,000 investment and turned it into a full-fledged outerwear business. His motto is \u201c360-degree warmth\u201d-\u2014a stalwart focus on environmental sustainability, animal welfare (all Wuxly coats are free of animal products) and ethical manufacturing. Plus, they\u2019re made in Canada by workers who make a living wage.\n\nShukri Abdulle | Productivity Manager, Bimbo Canada\n\nAfter four years in the leadership trainee program at Canada\u2019s largest and oldest bakery, Abdulle had a big task to \u201cmake our production chain as productive as possible.\u201d Automation is a new prospect at Bimbo, which, like many food and beverage multinationals, faces a labour shortage. At Bimbo, that shortfall could hit 65,000 by 2025. Its new gantry system is a 30,000 square-foot robotic system that \u201cdoes all our picking and sorting\u2014much faster and with better accuracy.\u201d Abdulle seamlessly led Bimbo from the old system to the new, saving $2.3 million a year in the process, all while training the company\u2019s humans to take on more skilled tasks robots can\u2019t do.\n\nKevin Read | President and CEO, Nomodic\n\nModular buildings, where components are put together off-site, are still a niche part of Canada\u2019s construction industry. But their many benefits\u2014including significantly lower costs and carbon-intensity, shorter timelines, and reduced waste\u2014make them a potential game changer in the current housing crisis. Read, who leads 10-year-old Nomodic, is among the country\u2019s foremost innovators focused on scaling up the modular business. Nomodic has worked on hundreds of projects, including housing for Indigenous communities that face supply and labour challenges. Its specialized modular assembly team, meanwhile, also supports the work of other companies\u2014living up to its motto, \u201cLeaving things better.\u201d\n\nTeresa Marques | President, Rideau Hall Foundation\n\nMarques says the word \u201cfoundation\u201d at the decade-old Rideau Hall Foundation is \u201ca bit of a misnomer.\u201d In four years, she\u2019s transformed the non-profit into a dynamo of powerful partnerships in support of a better Canada. Still, like all non-profits, she faced familiar hurdles: rasing money and getting innovative. She secured nearly $100 million from private and public donors (including $45 million to support Indigenous teachers), then put that money into better, more robust programs for young people, including a skill-building platform called Catapult and the Queen Elizabeth Scholars program in partnership with Canadian universities in honour of the late Queen.\n\nEva Lau | Founding Partner, Two Small Fish Ventures\n\nThe proportion of women leading venture funds in Canada is still minuscule, but entrepreneur-turned-investor Lau is helping turn that reality on its head. The former Wattpad exec co-founded Two Small Fish, a sector-agnostic fund that scales up companies using Lau\u2019s \u201casset framework\u201d\u2014a system focused on the value of user engagement. \u201cOperators and entrepreneurs like myself bring unique value to the ecosystem as investors because we have our own experiences to draw on,\u201d she says. In October, Two Small Fish closed a $24-million funding round, with an overall target of $40 million.\n\nJuanita Marois | CEO, M\u00e9tis Crossing\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my parents decided it would be easier for me to thrive if I didn\u2019t identify as an Indigenous person,\u201d says Marois, a citizen of the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta. Today, she works to ensure families never have to make a decision like that again. Marois was a key force in developing M\u00e9tis Crossing, a M\u00e9tis-owned gathering place and destination outside of Edmonton. From handmade quilts on the beds to a wildlife park that\u2019s home to heritage species like bison and elk, everything on the 668-acre property is designed to educate guests about M\u00e9tis heritage, provide a cultural home for citizens of the Indigenous nation, and feed into a self-sustaining economy designed to ensure continuous M\u00e9tis stewardship of the land.\n\nMelissa Allen | Founder, Capital M Ventures\n\nIn 2018, Allen was disturbed by a study that found self-driving cars had trouble recognizing people with darker skin tones and were more likely to hit them in tests. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but think that had something to do with the demographics of the teams designing the tech,\u201d she says. Aiming to increase diversity in Canada\u2019s venture capital landscape, she raised $1 million to launch Capital M, an industry-agnostic VC fund that focuses on BIPOC-founded businesses. This year alone, her fund raised $5 million to support BIPOC founders.\n\nNancy Wilson | Founder and CEO, Canadian Women\u2019s Chamber of Commerce\n\nCanada didn\u2019t have a Chamber of Commerce representing the interests of self-identified women and non-binary people until Wilson thought to create one in 2015. The CPA was moved by a near-complete lack of policy recommendations concerning women in the past few years, which she noticed while reviewing records from the Canadian and Ontario chambers of commerce. \u201cThere was no one speaking for us,\u201d she says. Now, Wilson works directly with policy makers to bring about equality in Canada\u2019s business ecosystem. Her advocacy goals for the near future centre on economic equity and access to capital; she\u2019s also putting together a cross-sector alliance to examine policy, or lack thereof, that supports self-employed Canadians.\n\nAjay Kochhar | Co-founder and CEO, Li-Cycle\n\nMining the lithium, nickel and cobalt that make up lithium-ion batteries\u2014used to power everything from electric vehicles to household appliances\u2014has heavy social and environmental impacts, and recycling those materials is highly complex. That\u2019s why Kochhar helped start Li-Cycle in 2016. It\u2019s now the North American leader focused on lithium-ion battery recycling. Getting there meant creating novel tech that would significantly drive up the sustainability, scalability, and economic viability of battery recycling. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to continue to be a great Canadian success story,\u201d says Kochhar.\n\nSt\u00e9phanie Jules | Co-chair, Legal & Regulatory Compliance DE&I Council, BMO\n\nAt BMO\u2019s LRC group, Jules oversees 80 volunteers on the diversity council, which she\u2019ll be the first to admit is too often an empty buzzword. Her mission? \u201cA clear, extensive action plan that focuses on inclusion for all.\u201d Of many big changes at the bank, Jules has revamped the LRC group\u2019s hiring process to reduce bias and eliminate subjectivity. Thanks to her, instead of one decision-maker in a suit, would-be employees now face a diverse panel of trained interviewers representing different genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, skills and experiences.\n\nStephen Penstone | Senior Consultant, Quinn+Partners\n\nBefore a business makes any net-zero promises with respect to its real estate, it might want to call Penstone. \u201cIf they want to set a target but don\u2019t know the path to get there, I can help,\u201d he says. Penstone assesses each situation, develops measurement tools, devises a workable model and monitors progress\u2014all to help slash Canada\u2019s commercial real estate emissions, which account for 16% of greenhouse gas emissions, and meet Canada\u2019s commitments under the Paris Agreement by 2050. It\u2019s telling that Quinn has grown tenfold in less than a decade.\n\nBoluwaji Ogunyemi | Assistant Professor, Memorial University\n\nSt. John\u2019s\u2013based dermatologist Ogunyemi specializes in diseases that disproportionately affect or are commonly misdiagnosed in racialized people\u2014an emerging practice in this historically white-dominated field. Besides his role as a physician and assistant dean at Memorial University, he\u2019s a thought leader whose regular speaking engagements (including a TEDx talk) and numerous publications explore the long-neglected intersection between health, equity and diversity.\n\nKevin Lee | Founder, ImmiSearch\n\nCanada is set to bring in 465,000 immigrants in 2023. Unfortunately, since many immigrants begin their journey outside Canada, where the immigration consultant industry isn\u2019t always regulated, some are bound to get caught up in costly scams. Lee, whose own family emigrated from Korea, started Immi-Search in 2019\u2014a tech-enabled platform that allows potential immigrants to fill out applications themselves with step-by-step instructions and support from staff. The service costs less than half of what immigration consultants normally charge\u2014and the team is working to drive the cost even lower.\n\nAlfred Burgesson | Founder and CEO, Tribe Network\n\nBurgesson started his first business, a digital media marketing company, in his first year at Saint Mary\u2019s University; six entrepreneurial years later, the Ghanaian-Canadian launched the resource network he didn\u2019t have: Tribe Network, a Halifax-based online innovation hub and community of 700 BIPOC entrepreneurs. There, they find help accessing capital, educational programming, coaching and mentorship. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a space for anyone who looked like me,\u201d he says, \u201cso I built it.\u201d\n\nAlwar Pillai | Co-founder and CEO, Fable\n\nThe internet is still widely inaccessible to users with disabilities, and efforts to make websites accessible too often focus on bare-minimum compliance. Pillai\u2019s Toronto startup wants to make digital accessibility the norm rather than the exception. \u201cOver a billion people live with a disability. It\u2019s high time digital products adapt to everyone\u2019s needs,\u201d she says. Companies can use her platform to access testers with disabilities and engage them throughout product development, or access custom training from an in-house team of experts. The four-year-old company has raised $40 million in venture capital financing, and past clients include Wealthsimple, Shopify and Kijiji.\n\nVass Bednar | Executive Director, Master of Public Policy in Digital Society, McMaster University\n\nBednar is on a mission to make public policy accessible, understandable and\u2026fun? \u201cI\u2019m trying to bring levity and playfulness to discussions about policy, and technology and competition law,\u201d says Bednar, whose popular \u201cregs to riches\u201d newsletter calls for Canadians to get passionate about the intersection between public policy (a.k.a. the regs) and the innovation ecosystem (the riches). Last year, Bednar took on shady apps on Shopify Inc. and Cineplex\u2019s exhibition monopolization.\n\nVarun Chandak | Founder and President, Access to Success\n\nWhen Chandak moved from India to study business in Canada, he deliberately left his disability\u2014he\u2019s hard of hearing and has Erb Palsy\u2014off his application. Many people like him do; according to his organization\u2019s own research, of two-thirds of MBA students who require accommodations, a full quarter don\u2019t even ask. For them, and for anyone else committed to a more equitable workplace, Chandak founded Access to Success, which he grew from a student initiative at the Rotman School of Management to a not-for-profit dedicated to accelerating accessibility for future leaders with disabilities. While some solutions are large and lofty\u2014Chandak dreams about \u201csmart contact lenses that would give me live captioning\u201d\u2014others are surprisingly easy to make a reality: 15 of the 25 most requested accommodations, he found, cost exactly zero dollars.\n\nZak Lefevre | Co-founder and CEO, ChargeLab\n\nFor more than 10 million EV drivers and counting, Lefevre is about to make life much easier with what he hopes will be the \u201cAndroid of the electric charging market.\u201d Charging stations are too often rows of single stations, each with a finicky credit-card machine. ChargeLab builds back-end software for buildings and communities to invest in their own stations, monitor and optimize electric-fuel distribution over the grid, and\u2014for 10,000 users who\u2019ve already embraced the new technology\u2014streamline the sometimes-frustrating process. \u201cWith ChargeLab, you just scan the QR code, and our app pulls up all your information.\u201d\n\nYour time is valuable.
