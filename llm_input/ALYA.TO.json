            "article_text": "The report calls on operators to implement responsible practices that mitigate the risk of in-orbit collision, minimise the threat of non-trackable debris, protect humans in space and limit effects on optical astronomy.\n\n\u201cSatellites in all orbits deliver vital satellite connectivity and high throughput broadband services. While they offer great promises in bridging the digital divide, they must be launched, deployed, operated and disposed of in a responsible manner,\u201d said Isabelle Mauro, director general of GSOA.\n\nThe Code of Conduct outlines four space sustainability areas which GSOA is recommending operators comply with.\n\nThe first is mitigating the risk of in-orbit collision. Specifically, it says operators should take all reasonable steps to share information with other operators about trackable debris that they may have or may not have generated through the operation of their spacecraft.\n\nSecond is minimising the threat of non-trackable debris. GSOA says that operators should take steps during the design, launch, orbit raising, operational and de-orbit phases of the spacecraft mission \u2013 to ensure that their satellites do not become debris.\n\n\u201cThe satellite industry has proven vital to helping bridge the digital divide and connect the unconnected, whether they are on land, at sea or in the air. These vital services depend on protecting and preserving access to space,\u201d said Dan Goldberg, CEO of Telesat Corporation and GSOA chairman.\n\n\u201cThe development and industry-wide approval of the Code of Conduct is an important step in identifying best practices and mitigations to preserve access to space for future generations.\u201d\n\nThe third area concerns the preservation of human life in space. The association says that human life should be protected, and operators should ensure that astronauts are not put at risk.\n\nThe fourth and final area is limiting the impact on optical astronomy. The Code of Conduct believes that operators and astronomers should work together to minimise negative impacts on ground-based optical astronomy, while allowing observation at optical wavelengths and ensuring the delivery of satellite services.\n\n\u201cAs the satellite industry continues to grow and is expected to bring socio-economic benefits worth more than US$250 billion globally, it is important that the industry works together to implement key sustainability practices that enable the world to continue benefitting from satellites,\u201d said Ali Alhashemi, group CEO of Yahsat and GSOA vice-chair.\n\nGSOA represents over 70 Members, all satellite operators, leads in addressing global challenges, seizing opportunities, and providing a unified voice for the satellite industry.\n\n\u201cThe Code of Conduct is a significant first step in safeguarding space resources. GSOA will continue to analyse additional matters and progress its work and efforts in this important area,\u201d added Eva Berneke, CEO of Eutelsat Group and GSOA vice-chair."
