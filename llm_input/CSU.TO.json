            "article_text": "By Stacy Kauk, Head of Sustainability at Shopify\n\nClimate change is the biggest challenge of our time. No single solution will solve it alone. That makes it a meaty, complex, and multi-layered problem\u2014exactly the type Shopify loves to solve.\n\nEven if emissions stopped today, there\u2019d still be too much carbon in the atmosphere. That\u2019s why our Sustainability Fund is obsessed with advancing and expanding the market for carbon removal technologies.\n\nHere are three things we learned about carbon removal in 2023, and where we want to see progress in 2024.\n\nThe market for carbon removal is growing\u2026 but not fast enough\n\nShopify believes in the power of entrepreneurship\u2014and we apply this principle to our carbon removal choices. We look for tech-driven climate entrepreneurs around the world who share our values and believe, as we do, that we must innovate our way to a sustainable future.\n\nLast summer, Running Tide completed the world\u2019s first open ocean carbon removal project. We were their first customer, helping to fund their research . Our contribution to their pilot project removed 100 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for more than 1,000 years by sinking biomass to the ocean floor. They\u2019re one of many companies in our portfolio making big moves in their domains.\n\nBut carbon removal is a big, gnarly problem that can\u2019t be solved by Shopify and other corporate buyers alone. We\u2019re doing our part to kickstart the market, but it will take way more than just us.\n\nIn 2022 , Shopify co-founded the world\u2019s first advance market commitment (AMC) for carbon removal: Frontier . Along with Stripe, Alphabet, Meta, and McKinsey Sustainability, we accomplished a lot this year:\n\nMay : Shopify and other Frontier buyers signed a total of $53 million in offtakes from Charm Industrial to remove 112,000 tons of CO\u2082 between 2024 and 2030. Offtakes are commercial contracts where you pay when the credits are delivered. Shopify and other Frontier buyers signed a total of $53 million in offtakes from Charm Industrial to remove 112,000 tons of CO\u2082 between 2024 and 2030. Offtakes are commercial contracts where you pay when the credits are delivered.\n\nSeptember : Shopify, Stripe, and H&M pre-purchased a combined total of $7 million of carbon removal from 12 early-stage companies. Pre-purchases provide a small injection of interest-free capital and send an important market signal. Shopify, Stripe, and H&M pre-purchased a combined total of $7 million of carbon removal from 12 early-stage companies. Pre-purchases provide a small injection of interest-free capital and send an important market signal.\n\nNovember : Shopify and other Frontier buyers signed a total of $46.6 million in Direct Air Capture (DAC) offtakes with Heirloom and CarbonCapture Inc. Shopify and other Frontier buyers signed a total of $46.6 million in Direct Air Capture (DAC) offtakes with Heirloom and CarbonCapture Inc.\n\nDecember : Shopify and other Frontier buyers signed a combined total of $57.1 million in offtake agreements for enhanced weathering (accelerating the natural storage of carbon in rocks) with Lithos Carbon to remove 154,000 tons of CO\u2082 between 2024 and 2028. This was the world\u2019s first enhanced weathering offtake. Shopify and other Frontier buyers signed a combined total of $57.1 million in offtake agreements for enhanced weathering (accelerating the natural storage of carbon in rocks) with Lithos Carbon to remove 154,000 tons of CO\u2082 between 2024 and 2028. This was the world\u2019s first enhanced weathering offtake.\n\nShopify is empowering sustainable commerce and has made significant impacts on the carbon removal market since launching our Sustainability Fund more than four years ago.\n\nKey stats from 2023:\n\n2024 lookahead \ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\nCarbon removal technology is taking off. Many pioneering companies have achieved technical milestones while gaining proof of concept and running pilot projects, and a few companies are working on their first large deployment. Progress is here! Still, we need more action to accelerate impact. In 2024, we want to see:\n\n\n\nMore players stepping up to the table to fund carbon removal projects. That includes governments, and we encourage more corporate buyers to join us in Frontier. A focus on project development and fast innovation cycles. Support for tech that will drive decarbonization in tough sectors \u2013 like steel, cement, and petrochemicals. If we can demonstrate proof of concept, this could spur wide-spread adoption and accelerate us toward a fully decarbonized world.\n\nWe need to hold ourselves & the climate industry accountable\n\nThis spring, we shared Shopify\u2019s 2022 Climate Report , our scorecard to assess the performance of the Sustainability Fund, our portfolio companies, and the state of the carbon removal market.\n\nWe named three key areas that are essential to the supply and affordability of carbon removal in the long-term, and documented where they stood at the beginning of 2022:\n\nTechnology: development is progressing well but deployment has some challenges\n\nFinancing : promising ideas need funding before their first buyer\n\nCommercialization: policy support is growing, but Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) still needs real solutions\n\nWe\u2019re working on our 2023 Climate Report which we\u2019ll share next year. My early take? 2023 was even stronger than 2022.\n\nThis year, more of our portfolio companies moved from prototype to pilot than ever before. Project developers stepped up and expedited progress. But it\u2019s not all rosy: venture funding has been a challenge for some companies.\n\nOn the MRV front, Puro and Isometric have introduced new carbon removal protocols, and the EU aims to establish a certification framework in Europe. CarbonPlan and Frontier\u2019s work on verification confidence levels has helped set a standard, but even with all of this, we need more action to tackle uncertainty.\n\n2024 lookahead \ud83d\udc40 We need to build a market and build trust in that market if we want to scale carbon removal meaningfully. In 2024, we want to see: Shopify and other companies sharing lessons learned so we can help lower the learning curve for others. Resisting the safe path. Don\u2019t opt out of sharing your climate action in fear of being called out for not doing enough or not doing the \u2018right\u2019 thing. Existing and new standard bodies introducing new protocols and updating existing ones based on industry feedback and new science, to create better MRV solutions.\n\nWe need to make carbon removal more accessible\n\nWe\u2019ve revamped our Planet app , connecting Shopify merchants with the incredible companies in our Sustainability Fund. With Planet, merchants can offer carbon-neutral shipping on every order. It's a triple win: entrepreneurs can easily offset carbon emissions from their order shipments, delight their sustainability-focused customers, and drive demand for carbon removal.\n\nSo far, Shopify merchants have used Planet on millions of orders, purchasing high-quality carbon removal from companies within our fund. We also introduced new ways for merchants to share their progress with their customers. Customizable badges can now display a business' own carbon removal contributions to companies like Heirloom, Running Tide, Grassroots Carbon, Remora, and more.\n\nAnd for the fourth straight year, Shopify neutralized the carbon emissions from shipping every single order made through our platform over the Black Friday-Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. We used a rigorous formula built by Shopify data scientists, and worked with our fund partners to remove CO\u2082 emissions equal to the entire BFCM shipping footprint.\n\nKey stats from 2023:\n\n2024 lookahead \ud83d\udc40 Along with making carbon removal accessible to more types of businesses, we also need to reduce emissions more broadly in commerce. In 2024, we want to see: More sustainable aviation fuel and clean vehicles make their way into the freight and logistics industry. Investment in, and incentives for, green infrastructure for all kinds of businesses\u2014from entrepreneurs to multinationals. Increased transparency around green claims. In other words, RIP greenwashing.\n\nThe carbon removal market is at a truly historic moment in time, bursting with new ideas. More entrepreneurs are pursuing innovative solutions with increased investments coming from the market.\n\nAs much as we hate dampening our enthusiasm, we need to be very clear here: there is still a loooong way to go, and we can\u2019t afford to wait.\n\nNext year, let\u2019s head down that road together. Let\u2019s close the gap between where we are and where we need to be. Let\u2019s do it for our planet, for future generations, for ourselves, and for the simple fact that it\u2019s about freakin\u2019 time."

            "article_text": "Climate x Capital: Bringing Leaders Together To Reimagine a More Sustainable Tomorrow\n\nOct 30, 2023 9:55 AM ET\n\nNasdaq\n\nWith each passing year, the urgency to address climate change grows. The global temperature is rising, the number of natural disasters \u2014 from droughts and cyclones to fires and earthquakes \u2014 is increasing, and as a result, the economic cost of climate change is climbing.\n\nIn the United States, the cost of climate and weather disasters in 2022 totaled more than $165 billion, the third most costly year on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). As of Sept. 11, 2023, there have been 23 confirmed climate disaster events in the U.S. this year with losses exceeding $1 billion each. And yet, these figures fail to represent the devastation from lives lost and the effects on families and communities upended and displaced by climate crises.\n\nIn recognition that climate change will continue to have far-reaching effects on the economy and society and to help kick off NYC Climate Week 2023, Nasdaq hosted \u201cClimate x Capital,\u201d a half-day summit that convened key leaders from across the climate ecosystem \u2014 including investors, founders, experts, advocates and diplomats \u2014 to discuss how we can most effectively connect climate solutions to capital.\n\nAt the summit\u2019s opening fireside chat, Nasdaq Global Head of Listings Karen Snow sat down with former United States Vice President Al Gore, who shared that when he began his political career as a congressman in the U.S. House of Representatives, conversations around global warming and climate were just beginning. Now, we\u2019re seeing real change in the public and private sectors and, as a result, consumer behavior \u2014 pointing specifically to the growth in the electric vehicle industry, the rise of LED lights and expansion in even newer industries like green steel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that\u2019s powered in part by the new information technologies,\u201d said Gore, who is the co-founder and chairman of Generation Investment Management. \u201cThe sustainability revolution is likely to have the scale of the industrial revolution, coupled with the speed of the digital revolution.\"\n\nHowever, all speakers acknowledged this isn\u2019t just about the work of \u201cclimate companies;\u201d this is about all companies joining the conversation.\n\nIn a session on how organizations can maximize impact, Climate Cardinals Founder Sophia Kianni emphasized the need for cross-industry collaboration. Kianni specifically highlighted the need for companies to share expertise, resources and technology.\n\nChief Commercialization Officer of The Department of Energy (DOE) Dr. Vanessa Chan also echoed the importance of collaborating in the fight against climate change, speaking about how the private sector can best partner with the DOE.\n\nShe emphasized that while the DOE is utilizing resources from the Inflation Reduction Act to buy down risk, in the end, it\u2019s the $23 trillion in the private sector that is going to be able to commercialize things.\n\n\u201c[The DOE is trying] to use the IRA money in a way that gets us to the point that the risk has gotten down and we can actually get the private sector to engage,\u201d Dr. Chan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll need the private sector to move towards us. We need you guys to be less risk averse and to actually think about ways in which you\u2019re going to maybe not get the ROI you want, not hit the hurdle rate you want, but have the impact that we need.\u201d\n\nDuring the summit, we heard from industry leaders across the e-commerce, carbon removal and food industry space about how they are driving impact, the role they are playing in the climate revolution and some of the struggles they are currently facing.\n\nAlthough being a green company isn\u2019t in their mission statement, when Shopify began its journey as a public company, the management team immediately began looking at the changes they would have to make to their company to ensure they would be around for the long run \u2014 starting with their environmental footprint, said Shopify Head of Sustainability Stacy Kauk. Shopify joined forces with companies such as Climeworks to work to reduce the amount of carbon in the air. Climeworks CFO Andreas Aepli acknowledged that in order to grow Climeworks, they must be able to scale the carbon removal process even further while educating the public on the difference between carbon removal and carbon reduction.\n\nImpossible Foods CEO Peter McGuinness shared the early struggles his climate-friendly company has faced as it has scaled. When Impossible Foods first launched, its marketing strategy revolved around teaching people about the environmental benefits of the product; however, McGuinness quickly learned what people cared about was taste. He learned that to effectively scale, his marketing strategy had to focus on how the product would benefit the consumer directly. Lowercarbon General Partner Clay Dumas echoed this sentiment, adding that consumers aren\u2019t going to purchase something because of guilt. Instead, sustainable products need to be better, stronger, faster and cheaper, he said.\n\nThe climate issue is not a problem for any one specific industry, nor is it a problem for only the public or private sector \u2014 it\u2019s everyone\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cThis is the defining challenge of our time,\u201d Gore said. \u201cWhat a privilege it is to be alive at a time when the generation of those of us alive on earth in this decade have an opportunity to really make history that counts. Future generations will look back, and they will either curse us... or they will say \u2018thank God they stepped up.\u2019\u201d"

Of those, 18K tons are expected to be delivered in 2024.\n\nVaulted\u2019s approach offers 10K+ year permanence, near-term scalability, local co-benefits and has a line of sight to under $100 cost per ton.\n\nFrontier has facilitated offtake agreements with Vaulted Deep, a carbon removal company that injects carbon-rich organic waste deep underground for permanent storage. Vaulted spun out of\u2014and uses core tech from\u2014Advantek Waste Management, a 10-year old industrial waste management company. Frontier buyers will pay $58.3 million to permanently remove 152,480 tons of CO\u2082 between 2024 and 2027, with options to purchase more tons from future projects at lower prices. Frontier buyers were Vaulted\u2019s first customers in September 2023 through a small prepurchase of 1,666 tons\u2014all of which have already been delivered and verified. This offtake agreement enables Vaulted to commission three new wells that are sited to optimize feedstock availability, transportation, and well capacity. As one of the first carbon removal spin-outs from a waste management company, Vaulted is an example of growing interest from large industrials to apply their expertise and assets to carbon removal.\n\nVaulted\u2019s approach starts with plants that naturally draw down CO\u2082 from the atmosphere via photosynthesis. Much of that ends up as carbon-rich waste in the form of biosolids, manure, food or agricultural waste that is incinerated, landfilled, or spread on land. As that waste burns or decomposes, the once-captured CO\u2082 is released back into the atmosphere. Vaulted prevents that re-release by turning the waste into a carbon-rich slurry and then injecting it into deep disposal wells for permanent geologic storage. The volume of carbon removed is measured by weighing the carbon in the biomass and subtracting emissions generated at every stage in the process, including transportation and energy usage.\n\nVaulted\u2019s method of removing CO\u2082 via underground injection of waste biomass.\n\nVaulted\u2019s approach is compelling for a few reasons:\n\nThe potential for scale is large, thanks to an abundance of waste and flexible storage options . Waste biomass has the potential to deliver >300Mt of carbon removal annually in the US alone and a potential for 5Gt of capacity globally in theory\u00b9. It can be injected underground using Class V injection wells or their equivalents, widely used to safely dispose of byproducts generated by industrial and agricultural activities. These wells can be built in a large variety of locations, making storage functionally unlimited for this approach.\n\n.

It can be injected underground using Class V injection wells or their equivalents, widely used to safely dispose of byproducts generated by industrial and agricultural activities. These wells can be built in a large variety of locations, making storage functionally unlimited for this approach. The cost is relatively low today, and there\u2019s a believable path to well under $100 per ton . This is due to 3 factors: 1) the CO\u2082 capture process happens naturally via photosynthesis at no cost, and wastes are aggregated by existing industrial infrastructure; 2) slurry injection technology can be done with minimal feedstock processing before injection, virtually eliminating processing costs; and 3) facility capex is inexpensive and uses commercially available equipment and construction services. A big driver of cost today is transportation\u2014Vaulted transports biomass waste from waste partner sites, like landfills or waste water treatment facilities, to the injection wells. In the future, they will work with waste partners to co-locate injection wells directly on their sites, eliminating transportation costs.\n\n.

The assets and expertise inherited from Advantek mean Vaulted\u2019s poised to execute safely and quickly . As a spinoff from an established waste disposal company, Vaulted benefits from already-permitted well infrastructure as well as a team with longstanding operational experience and expertise in deep well waste injection technology. They\u2019re set up to deliver CDR quickly and safely using mature, proven injection technology, and without a lengthy research and development period. Since launching late last year, Vaulted has already delivered several thousand tons, including 1,666 tons to Frontier buyers, as part of a small-volume prepurchase. As part of this offtake, Vaulted plans to deliver 18,321 tons to Frontier this year.\n\n.

Vaulted\u2019s feedstock is sludgy waste like biosolids, manure, food and ag waste, and papermill sludge. These wastes are typically incinerated or spread on land for disposal, which can create a number of problems for nearby communities, including soil, water and air pollution, and foul odor. Diverting organic biomass waste to permanent sequestration has the potential to reduce environmental and human health harms in surrounding communities.\n\nFrontier has facilitated purchases on behalf of Frontier Founding Members Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify, Meta, and McKinsey Sustainability, as well as Autodesk, H&M Group, JPMorgan Chase, and Workday. Also, Aledade, Canva, SKIMS, Skyscanner, Wise, and Zendesk have purchased via Watershed\u2019s partnership with Frontier.\n\nBiomass-based approaches to carbon removal are promising but require thoughtful biomass sourcing to have the intended climate impact. To help inform prospective customers of companies like Vaulted doing Biomass Carbon Removal and Storage, we\u2019re sharing Frontier\u2019s Biomass Sourcing Principles.\n\nJulia Reichelstein, CEO at Vaulted Deep: \u201cVaulted\u2019s technology, developed by Advantek, has been primed to address carbon removal for decades\u2014even before there was a market. Technologies like ours that can scale quickly without compromising durability or quality will lead the way. Our proven CDR is what makes possible Frontier\u2019s largest offtake to date.\u201d\n\nRelated Article: Frontier Publishes its First-Ever ESG Report\n\nHannah Bebbington, Strategy Lead at Frontier: \u201cVaulted went from inception to delivering thousands of tons in just eight months and is now among the first carbon removal companies to sign a multi-million dollar offtake agreement. This shows what\u2019s possible when the expertise of traditional industry players is repurposed for carbon removal.\u201d"

This guide to sustainable business will show you exactly what it means to be sustainable, why it\u2019s important, and what sustainable business practices you can put in place.\n\nWhat is a sustainable business?\n\nA sustainable business aims to positively impact the environment and society\u2014or, at the very least, reduce the negative impact it has on these areas.\n\nIt analyzes every step in its manufacturing, shipping, and selling processes to identify where it can become more sustainable, reduce its carbon footprint, and do better for the planet.\n\nEach decision is backed by the desire to improve the environment, whether through natural materials, community initiatives, or focusing on long-term plans rather than short-term gains.\n\nSustainability efforts focus on three core pillars:\n\nPeople Planet Profit\n\nKeeping these three pillars in mind ensures the fair treatment of employees and local communities while minimizing (or reversing) environmental impacts.\n\nIs it the same as an eco-friendly business?\n\nThe terms \u201ceco-friendly\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d are often used interchangeably. While there are many similarities, there are some important differences too. Sustainable businesses aim to maintain a prosperous economy for future generations and make choices that don\u2019t deplete the earth\u2019s natural resources.\n\nEco-friendly businesses aim to minimize or eradicate harmful effects on the environment. In eco-friendly businesses, everything from production to packaging must be safe for the environment.\n\nWhat makes a business sustainable?\n\nSustainable businesses implement strategies touching on the three pillars: people, profit, and planet. They aim to reduce any negative environmental and societal impact their operations have by tackling global issues like:\n\nClimate change\n\nHuman rights issues\n\nFair working conditions\n\nPollution\n\nIncome inequality\n\nDepletion of natural resources\n\nRacial injustice\n\nGender inequality\n\nFor example, the organic snack brand Nature\u2019s Path is committed to producing products without toxic farm chemicals and encourages employees to reduce their consumption in any way possible. Similarly, Salt Spring Coffee has become carbon neutral by reducing long-range trucking, upgrading to energy-efficient equipment, and using biodiesel in delivery trucks.\n\nNature\u2019s Path promotes its natural ingredients and community initiatives on each product page.\n\nWhy is sustainability important in business?\n\nAs well as curbing global issues like climate change and inequality, sustainability drives business success in several ways.\n\nIncrease the chance of investment\n\nInvestors often use environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics to determine the impact of a company. They\u2019ll use this information to decide whether or not to invest and are more likely to back a brand with a lower carbon footprint.\n\nImprove financial performance\n\nResearch by McKinsey shows companies with a high ESG rating are more likely to have a lower cost of debt. It also found brands with effective sustainability initiatives perform better financially.\n\nMeet customer expectations\n\nConsumers expect brands to be sustainable\u2014and they\u2019ll pay more for it. Some 90% of consumers are willing to spend an extra 10% on more sustainable products.\n\nGain a competitive edge\n\nMeeting customer demands and showing you understand current global concerns will give you a competitive advantage over brands that are carrying on as normal.\n\nReduce costs\n\nWorking toward a more sustainable future can actually save you money. Some 33% of businesses that integrate a sustainability strategy to improve their efficiency manage to drive down costs and can boost profits by as much as 60%.\n\nHow to create a more sustainable business model\n\nAssess the problem (or problems) Define the objectives of your sustainability plan Outline your sustainable business strategy Implement your practices Assess your results\n\n1. Assess the problem (or problems)\n\nThe first step in becoming more sustainable is figuring out what problems you\u2019re up against. What matters in one industry might not be important in another, so it\u2019s critical to examine the key sustainability problems spanning your team, company, customers, and industry.\n\nDetermine what each of these groups considers a priority\u2014is it reducing your carbon footprint or providing opportunities to marginalized communities around the world?\n\nHere are some sample questions you can ask each group to determine what matters most:\n\nWhat impact does the business have on the local community?\n\nHow much waste are we creating?\n\nWhat does our company culture look like?\n\nDoes our hiring process attract diverse job candidates?\n\nHow are we minimizing our impact on the planet?\n\n2. Define the objectives of your sustainability plan\n\nOnce you know what the biggest issues are, you can start to put together your sustainable business strategy. This will depend on your target audience, your product, and what you consider to be important.\n\nIf you\u2019ve discovered your hiring process isn\u2019t diverse or you\u2019re producing far more waste than necessary, you can set objectives to tackle these issues. For example, you can set a goal to reduce waste by 5% month-over-month or aim to improve your hiring process by seeking help from external professionals.\n\nUse SMART goals to create realistic objectives. Each goal should be:\n\nSpecific\n\nMeasurable\n\nAchievable\n\nRelevant\n\nTime-based\n\nThis ensures you\u2019re not creating unrealistic goals and have tangible outcomes to work toward. Use these objectives to create a mission statement you can circulate internally and one you can publish on your website.\n\n3. Outline your sustainable business strategy\n\nYour business strategy should create a fine balance between improving your impact on the planet and ensuring you still turn a decent profit. After all, you can\u2019t help save the planet and its people if you go out of business.\n\nCreate two layers to your strategy:\n\nSmall sustainable changes Big sustainable changes\n\nThe small changes can be little things like turning the electricity and heat off overnight or using a motion sensor to automatically switch off lights when no one is in the building. It could also include activities like switching out your current packaging in favor of more eco-friendly materials.\n\nBigger changes need more time to be implemented but can lead to higher-impact results. For example, you might set up local initiatives to provide living wages to community artisans who help make your products or replace your existing equipment with energy-efficient versions.\n\nYour strategy should ultimately lead you toward your sustainability objectives, which is why it\u2019s important to choose goals that you can realistically measure.\n\n4. Implement your practices\n\nCreating a strategy and implementing it are two very different things. When you\u2019ve decided what you want to achieve and how you\u2019re going to get there, it\u2019s time to put the steps in place to make it a reality.\n\nWhen implementing your sustainability practices, think about:\n\nWhat resources you need to make it happen\n\nWhat milestones you can create to make it more manageable\n\nWhat the timeline will look like for each activity\n\nWhether you need buy-in from external stakeholders\n\nHow you\u2019ll track the results of your efforts\n\n5. Assess your results\n\nLike any strategy, you won\u2019t know if your sustainability plans are a success unless you track them against your initial objectives. Remember to revisit your goals regularly to make sure you\u2019re still on track and are getting the results you hoped for. This is a good opportunity to determine if you need to change tactics or create bigger goals.\n\nChoose key metrics to track, such as your carbon footprint, the percentage of waste, reduced electricity bills, or the number of local organizations you\u2019ve partnered with. This will give you clear, measurable ways to track your progress.\n\nExamples of sustainability in business\n\nThe sustainability strategies you choose to implement in your business will be unique to your operations, missions, and industry\u2014no two strategies are exactly the same. This means sustainability in business can take on many different forms, including:\n\nThe use of sustainable materials in the manufacturing process\n\nOptimizing supply chains that aim to reduce emissions\n\nPartnering with community initiatives to reduce waste\n\nSponsoring educational needs in marginalized communities\n\nUsing renewable energy sources to power production lines\n\nHere are some real-life business sustainability strategies in action.\n\nMeow Meow Tweet: Sustainable packaging with clear instructions\n\nNew York\u2013based natural vegan skin care company Meow Meow Tweet does a great job of working with sustainable packaging. There\u2019s an optimal way to discard or recycle every element of its product packaging, including paper boxes, glass jars, and paper tubes, and it makes that very clear to customers.\n\nOn every product page, you\u2019ll see The Breakdown. Take the page for Meow Meow Tweet\u2019s Rose Geranium deodorant, where it tells you its paper tube and seal can be disposed of in your backyard or municipal compost.\n\nMeow Meow Tweet has a section called The Breakdown on each product page that shows how packaging can be recycled.\n\nUnited By Blue: Minimizing material waste and creating a circular business model\n\nPhiladelphia-based United By Blue uses bison fiber as insulation in its apparel products. It\u2019s a layer of the bison\u2019s shaggy coat that is shaved off as part of regular maintenance. When cofounders Brian Linton and Mike Cangi learned about this underused sustainable fiber, they created a supply chain that would give them access to it before it was thrown away. With that, they established a circular business model. And the company isn\u2019t sacrificing quality: Bison fiber is warm, moisture-wicking, lightweight, and soft.\n\nUnited By Blue uses a variety of salvaged materials, including bison wool.\n\nTwo Days Off: Using 100% renewable energy to power the office\n\nTwo Days Off is an independent, women-owned carbon neutral lifestyle brand based in California. Not only does it focus on thoughtfully crafted clothes, it also wants to put consumers at ease, knowing its sustainable clothing manufacturing didn\u2019t come at a cost to the environment.\n\nWith the help of nonprofit Climate Neutral, Two Days Off measured its emissions and is taking steps to procure 100% renewable energy for its office operations. It also works with suppliers to limit the use of air freight and supports factory partners in energy efficiency improvement. Then, it offsets any remaining greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSeventh Generation: Green products and sustainable practices\n\nHome care brand Seventh Generation uses plastic-free packaging and zero-plastic solutions that aim to make the world a better place for the next seven generations.\n\nAlong with sourcing plant-based ingredients to use in its products, the brand is committed to paying all workers in the supply chain a living wage, regardless of their place of work. Seventh Generation is also a B Corporation, which means it meets the highest standards for verified social and environmental performance.\n\nSome of the sustainable initiatives Seventh Generation is committed to.\n\nPatagonia: Encouraging responsible consumption\n\nOutdoor brand Patagonia doesn\u2019t buy into the fast fashion craze. Instead, it does the exact opposite, encouraging shoppers to return broken, worn, and old items so they can be repaired and redelivered.\n\nThe brand\u2019s Worn Wear program allows customers to trade in and buy used Patagonia gear to reduce emissions and overall consumption.\n\nPatagonia\u2019s Worn Wear initiative includes an online store for used clothes.\n\nSustainability for the planet and profit\n\nReady to start contributing to the health of the planet in addition to your business\u2019s bottom line? By following the recommendations above, you\u2019ll join the growing small business movement to protect the planet for future generations (and entrepreneurs). What\u2019s more, you\u2019ll find buyers ready and waiting to support you.\n\nShare your sustainability success with customers using Shopify Email Share the good news with your customers.

            "article_text": "Beyond the products and services they sell, founders of socially responsible businesses and social enterprises are building for the future by creating systems that create change. They operate with moral imperatives that let them navigate business decisions while keeping the community, economy, and environment in mind.\n\nEngaging in socially responsible business practices has many benefits: a better brand image, happier employees, and improved revenue. Whether it\u2019s climate change, low energy consumption, or social justice, many socially responsible companies are stepping up to create a better world.\n\nNeed some inspiration for planning your social responsibility efforts? Learn from 13 companies, both big and small, working for a healthier planet.\n\nWhat is corporate social responsibility (CSR)?\n\nWhile traditional companies see corporate social responsibility as an additional project outside their main goal of profit, socially responsible businesses maintain lifelong relationships with nonprofit partners and social enterprises creating ventures that are cause-driven and powered by social objectives.\n\nWhy is CSR important?\n\nPeople want their time and money to go to companies that are trying to make a positive impact on the world. Having a socially conscious company will help your business in three ways.\n\nIt boosts a company\u2019s image and brand\n\nThe CSR programs you decide to invest in will help your consumers and investors trust you. By building a brand image that shows you care about more than just your bottom line, you will attract customers who want to use their buying power to create positive change in the world.\n\nFifty-five percent of US consumers believe it\u2019s important for companies to take a stand on key social, environmental, and political issues. Seventy-three percent of investors say a company\u2019s ESG is a contributing factor that\u2019s taken into account when choosing to invest.\n\nIn fact, consumers are willing to pay a little more for products if they know a brand shares their view on social issues. For example, environmental sustainability is a big issue amongst Gen X and millennial consumers. First Insight did a study that showed 90% of Gen Xers said they were willing to pay more for sustainable eco-friendly products.\n\nIt attracts good employees and improves productivity\n\nIf you want to staff your company with the best employees, you need to invest in CSR initiatives.\n\nAccording to a study done by communications consultancy Porter Novelli, 90% of employees who work at companies with a strong sense of purpose say they\u2019re more inspired, motivated, and loyal. Another study found that 57% of employees left a company within two years if they were unsatisfied with the societal impact that company was making.\n\nYour CSR efforts should also include the well-being of your employees, and treating them as more than just cogs in a wheel. In the Porter Novelli study, 95% of employees believe businesses should benefit all stakeholders\u2014not just shareholders. This includes employees, customers, suppliers, partnerships, and the communities the company operates within.\n\nTaking your corporate citizenship seriously and providing things like sustainable materials and health care to your employees is going to attract a like-minded workforce. Not only will you have passionate employees, they will be more likely to stay with your company, be more productive, and be more motivated.\n\nIt improves bottom line\n\nYou may think devoting your time and energy to CSR means you\u2019ll need to sacrifice profits and derail time and resources. But 75% of consumers prefer to purchase from companies committed to making the world a better place. By fundraising and advocating for issues you care about, you will actually attract more customers who will be more loyal.\n\nRather than having your bottom line suffer because of your company\u2019s activism, it will actually improve, because people will seek out your brand and will be willing to pay more if it means supporting a company that aligns with their societal, environmental, or political ideals.\n\nAs an example, take a look at Nike\u2019s 30th anniversary ad campaign with Colin Kaepernick in 2018. The campaign was fraught with controversy over Kaepernick\u2019s peaceful protest for Black Lives Matter. Despite some people posting videos of them burning or throwing away their Nike gear, Nike\u2019s online sales jumped 31% the weekend after that ad ran.\n\n13 socially responsible companies to admire\n\n1. Sweet Beginnings\n\nBeelove is a line of all-natural honey and honey-infused body care products made by Sweet Beginnings, a social enterprise based in Chicago. Sweet Beginnings extracts its honey from the urban apiaries in the heart of the North Lawndale community and employs individuals returning from incarceration, offering a fresh chance at civilian life.\n\nFounded by Brenda Palms Barber, the organization originally wanted to address North Lawndale\u2019s 40% unemployment rate by providing training for landscaping or small motor repairs, but found its sweet spot with beekeeping.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an interesting parallel between bees and people returning to society from being incarcerated,\u201d says Daphne Williams, the company\u2019s Chief Growth Officer. \u201cPeople have a fear of bees and getting stung. People also have this perception about people who have been incarcerated. So having a business that married bees and formerly incarcerated people was a way to take the stigma out of both.\u201d\n\nBrenda Palms Barber founded Sweet Beginnings as a social enterprise to address the high unemployment rate within North Lawndale, Chicago. Sweet Beginnings\n\nWorking closely with the North Lawndale Employment Network, an organization that provides cognitive behavior therapy and training for re-entering the job market, Sweet Beginnings acts as a possible employer to program participants. As Daphne highlights, hiring previously incarcerated individuals \u201cis all about giving people confidence that they can actually go out and start looking for a job on their own\u201d once their work term with Sweet Beginnings ends.\n\nTaking the sting out of the fear of bees and previously incarcerated individuals, Sweet Beginnings is marrying the two as a way to reduce unemployment. Sweet Beginnings\n\nSweet Beginnings initially started selling Beelove products in the same community it was caring for. Local farmers markets and events proved to be great places to showcase Beelove\u2019s products and have employees reconnect with the public.\n\nDemand from the community also led to co-ops and retailers carrying Beelove products. \u201cIt\u2019s really about the alignment and the recognition of the work that we\u2019re doing in the community that has afforded us the opportunity to be in these retail spaces,\u201d says Daphne. As bigger business opportunities arrive and production scales, Daphne and her team are focused on finding the right balance between cause and commerce while putting their community first.\n\n2. ChocoSol Traders\n\nThe richness and depth of ChocoSol\u2019s chocolate and coffee reflect the social impact that this education-oriented social enterprise is making. But becoming a bean-to-bar chocolate maker and coffee roastery was almost an accident for founder Michael Sacco.\n\n\u201cI was working on solar technology for roasting coffee and cacao with Indigenous communities in Oaxaca, Mexico,\u201d says Michael. \u201cBut everyone was more excited about the chocolate and coffee than the renewable energy technology.\u201d The pivot from technology to food allowed Michael to use chocolate and coffee as a vehicle for ecological regeneration, education, and economic impact.\n\nFounder of ChocoSol, Michael Sacco, along with Don Flor, one of the farmers in Mexico who works directly with ChocoSol. ChocoSol\n\nThe ChocoSol team works directly with farmers on Indigenous forest gardens in Oaxaca and Chiapas to improve diversity of their natural ecosystems by focusing on \u201cpolyculture\u201d farming, where diverse crops are grown together, unlike traditional commercial farms, which only farm one lucrative crop.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re built into a communal land rotation which gives way to three sisters (winter squash, maize, and beans), forest gardens, and semi-wild forests. This cycle takes place over 100 years,\u201d says Michael. This long-term mentality\u2014keeping future generations in mind\u2014is how Michael carries out all areas of business. From operating as a learning community for knowledge sharing and passing on the art of chocolate making, to ensuring packaging materials are biodegradable and sourced sustainably.\n\nA selection of ChocoSol\u2019s chocolate, wrapped in biodegradable packaging. ChocoSol\n\nWorking directly with independent farmers is also Michael\u2019s way of bringing economic opportunities to the Indigenous communities of Oaxaca and Chiapas. \u201cBoth fair trade and organic certification are a barrier to entry when you\u2019re dealing not with one big plantation but with 150 independent producers in a region,\u201d says Michael. These smaller farmers lack the language and financial resources to get certified, even though their products are already grown organically. ChocoSol has always paid above the Fair Trade requirements to ensure its farmers and families are paid fairly.\n\nWorking directly with farmers is a chance for ChocoSol to directly impact the economy of communities in a positive way. ChocoSol\n\nMoving forward, Michael and team are taking up local projects to regenerate farm lands in Canada. Food waste from cacao roasting, which includes the burlap sacks the cacao is shipped in, are used to create a biochar that can be used as an all-natural fertilizer. \u201cWe\u2019ll be working with a local farmer near Hamilton, Ontario, to do a series of ecological regenerative planting of polycultures,\u201d says Michael. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a tree planted on the north part of the mountain, annual crop planted on the top of the mountain, and a perennial crop of possibly strawberries, mint, fiddleheads, or sweet grass planted on the south side of the mountain.\u201d\n\n3. TAMGA Designs\n\nTAMGA Designs is a sustainable clothing brand creating garments from trees. Life and business partners Eric and Yana Dales are not just creating fashion pieces but a sustainable lifestyle movement and are sharing the lessons they learn to inspire change within the industry.\n\nEric and Yana worked as humanitarian aid workers in Bangladesh, immersed in communities heavily impacted by the effects of fast fashion. \u201cWe were seeing many social and environmental problems. We had to start TAMGA to prove that it could be done better,\u201d says Eric.\n\nThe TAMGA Designs team: founders Yana Dales and Eric Dales and head designer Anna Valero Domenech. TAMGA Designs\n\nThe Dales\u2019 initial undertaking was to establish a socially and environmentally responsible supply chain that goes beyond traditional corporate social responsibility measures. Eric and Yana spent a lot of time searching for alternative fabrics with low environmental impact.\n\nTAMGA\u2019s pieces are made with Lenzing Modal, created from sustainably managed European forest beech wood, or Tencel made from eucalyptus wood, a renewable resource that doesn\u2019t infringe on land for food crops. Their Tencel fabrics are also processed into fiber through an award-winning closed-loop process, where 99.8% of the water and solvents used are recycled.\n\nEach part of their supply chain, from fabric mills to cotton farms, sewing factories to packaging makers, are listed on their website, not only for transparency, but also to share knowledge with others in the industry.\n\nEvery step in TAMGA Designs\u2019 process is publicly available, for both transparency and knowledge sharing. TAMGA Designs\n\nTAMGA Designs also shares its process for being a carbon-neutral company. By extensively tracking its carbon footprint for shipping to various countries through different methods, it then purchases offsets from Gold Standard. \u201cThese projects are not only going to bring back carbon absorption capacity into the environment, but they\u2019re also going to create jobs and benefit the communities where those projects are run,\u201d Eric says.\n\nYana Dales models one of TAMGA Designs\u2019 sustainable pieces. TAMGA Designs\n\nThe Dales are staying true to their main reason behind starting TAMGA Designs: knowledge sharing is at the heart of their attempt to motivate other brands to adopt more responsible business practices. Eric stresses that, \u201cIt\u2019s important for businesses to understand that investing in sustainability, if done correctly, is a good investment in their business as a whole.\u201d\n\n4. Satya\n\nSatya is a natural skincare company producing products that are plant-based as well as fragrance- and steroid-free. Made with just five organic ingredients, Satya\u2019s line provides relief to soothe and restore dry skin.\n\nPatrice Mousseau started Satya in 2013, soon after her daughter, Esme, was born and experienced a severe case of eczema. After being prescribed steroid creams and learning the dangers of using it on infants, Patrice leveraged her research skills as a journalist to find a natural alternative. \u201cI made my first batch in my Crock-Pot, and it cleared up Esme's eczema,\u201d Patrice says.\n\nWith much of the formula left over, she offered some to friends on Facebook. Friends and friends of friends returned to Patrice and asked for more. \u201cI had to make three more batches in the Crock-Pot right away, because I just could not keep up with people asking for it,\u201d she says.\n\nPatrice Mousseau with the Crock-Pot that started her journey of launching Satya. Satya\n\nPatrice never thought she would be launching a business and wondered if she would fit in the typical business world. But through the increase in demand from friends, she continued selling Satya\u2019s balms on the side.\n\nShe eventually started selling at farmers markets and events, which led to the attention of major retailers. \u201cWe ended up in about 70 stores in the lower mainland around Vancouver, just through word of mouth, and then Whole Foods wanted to start carrying our product,\u201d Patrice says. That relationship skyrocketed Satya\u2019s presence and saw Patrice\u2019s homemade recipe distributed in over 400 stores.\n\nSatya\u2019s skincare formula, in jar and stick format, packaged in recyclable and reusable containers. Satya\n\nAs the brand\u2019s retail presence brought in more sales through Satya\u2019s online shop, shipping played a bigger role in the business. \u201cInstead of going to a fulfillment house, we hired stay-at-home moms in different regions,\u201d says Patrice. \u201cWe ship them products, then they ship out to their own regions, which drops our shipping costs, employs them, and gets the products faster to customers.\u201d\n\nThinking creatively to benefit local economies, the environment, and her customers is how Patrice ensures each of Satya\u2019s business decisions is as socially impactful as possible. Satya\n\nSatya was Patrice\u2019s way of solving an issue in a more proactive way, and for every decision that followed Patrice has applied the same creativity and determination. When Satya\u2019s stick format had to incorporate plastic in its packaging, Patrice found the Plastic Bank as an offset partner.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re paying someone in a developing country to go to their local waterways and pull up plastic and then take that plastic to their local Plastic Bank depot,\u201d says Patrice. \u201cThey exchange it for credits that can be used in medical care, educational, or household items.\u201d On Satya\u2019s environmental impact front, Patrice works with the Great Bear Rainforest to offset her carbon emissions.\n\nMoving forward, Patrice is working on projects that will support other Indigenous communities and entrepreneurs, like herself. She knows firsthand how representation and support are important for communities to grow their economy and is finding ways to extend her impact back to areas like the one she grew up in, in northwestern Ontario\u2019s Sioux Lookout.\n\n5. Package Free\n\nLauren Singer\u2019s prominence in environmental activism was catapulted when her 2015 TedxTeen talk went viral. Showcasing how all of the trash she produced in the past three years fit into a 16-ounce Mason jar, Lauren shared her journey of carrying out a zero-waste lifestyle, something she documents on her site, Trash Is for Tossers. Moving beyond change on a personal level, Lauren started to look for environmental issues she could tackle on a macro level by creating businesses.\n\nOften dubbed the face of zero-waste living, Lauren Singer reduced the waste she accumulated over eight years to fit into one 16-ounce Mason jar. Package Free\n\n\u201cI'm a problem solver, and I think the function of business is to solve problems,\u201d says Lauren \u201cMore and more the problems of today are starting to center around climate change and the health and safety of our species and our planet.\u201d Lauren zoomed in on the issue of laundry detergent and wondered why it was filled with chemicals that harmed our waterways and came packaged in plastic.\n\nExperimenting with natural ingredients like baking soda, washing soda, and Castile soap, Lauren created The Simply Co., an organic laundry detergent that\u2019s safe for the planet. \u201cIt\u2019s my way to bring a product to market that I knew was safe and effective in order to take a stab at democratizing access to cleaner products,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nMade with less than a handful of natural ingredients, The Simply Co. laundry detergent is safe for the environment and packaged in a reusable container. Package Free\n\nIn the same vein, Lauren wanted to make it easier for consumers to find other alternatives to existing consumer goods that took less of a toll on the environment. As she discovered other businesses creating the products she envisioned, Lauren launched Package Free, a retail and online store that showcased sustainable alternatives to disposable items and household goods. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to aggregate all of these really amazing consumer product companies making products that are safe for our homes, our bodies, and the environment,\u201d Lauren says.\n\nLauren Singer in the retail location of Package Free. Package Free\n\nThroughout the years and the scaling of both businesses, Lauren has always maintaineda dialogue with readers and customers on Trash Is for Tossers. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Lauren shared the honest and personal news of breaking her zero-waste lifestyle.\n\n\u201cCOVID brought on a shift in the hierarchy of my values based on this new circumstance that we're facing,\u201d she says. \u201cI think values can shift based on circumstance. So while zero waste was my number one priority pre-COVID, my number one priority right now is the health and safety of myself and the people I love, including my employees and my family members.\u201d\n\nAlong with this transparency, the team at Package Free are working toward adapting to the impacts of COVID-19 by sourcing sustainable sanitizer and toilet paper, as well as creating education pieces on sustainability during the pandemic.\n\n6. Alaffia\n\nOlowo-n\u2019djo Tchala was born in Togo to a large family comprising a collective of 42 siblings. To support his mother, Olowo-n\u2019djo left school in the sixth grade to work on a farm, a common story within his community.\n\n\u201cWhat I learned growing up in my village in Kaboli is the extreme level of poverty that we live in,\u201d says Olowo-n\u2019djo. \u201cIn West Africa, we have all these resources as well as tradition and knowledge on how to use them, but I couldn\u2019t understand how those resources did not lift the poverty that we were living in.\u201d For Olowo-n\u2019djo, this meant a personal mission to find ways for the communities to leverage their resources and create economic opportunities.\n\nOlowo-n\u2019djo Tchala in front of the Alaffia\u2019s cooperative in Ghana. Alaffia\n\nOlowo-n\u2019djo then fell in love with Peace Corps volunteer Prairie Rose Hyde, moved to the United States, and completed his education at the University of California, Davis. In 2003, he formulated his idea of lifting Togo out of poverty by launching Alaffia and creating cooperatives to employ and empower women to develop natural resources into skin- and personal-care products, but banks and loan officers were not keen on the idea.\n\n\u201cPrairie Rose\u2019s brother was kind enough to put his house against the $50,000 loan and that\u2019s what we used to start the cooperative with about just 17 women,\u201d says Olowo-n\u2019djo.\n\nSome of Alaffia\u2019s top sellers feature African black soap as the main ingredient, as well as coconut oil and shea butter. Alaffia\n\nToday, Alaffia\u2019s products feature shea butter, coconut oil, African black soap, and other indigenous ingredients, and are sold in major chain, from Whole Foods to Walmart to Target, as well as in Alaffia\u2019s own online shop. Production of Alaffia\u2019s products supports the livelihood of almost 14,000 women.\n\nThe Alaffia Foundation, the company\u2019s charity arm, runs projects that focus on maternal care, education, sustainability, and vision care. A project that empower and aid in education is the donation of bicycles, which enables young women to travel to school. \u201cWe have over 10,000 bicycles, mostly given to young ladies,\u201d says Olowo-n\u2019djo. \u201cWe see 90% retention in schools as opposed to having a 40% dropout rate previously.\u201d\n\nSupporting the livelihoods of over 14,000 women, Alaffia is transforming natural resources in Togo into economic opportunities for the local communities. Alaffia\n\nAs Alaffia scales even more, Olowo-n\u2019djo says that his biggest challenge is shifting his priorities. \u201cI used to put bicycles in the shipping containers myself, but I realize it\u2019s better if I spend more of my energy working with the Togo government and the American embassy in Togo to facilitate when the containers arrive.\u201d Prarie Rose and Olowo-n\u2019djo both had a hard time letting go of tasks like packing orders and labelling their soaps, but they know it\u2019s a necessary step for Alaffia and its communities to grow.\n\n7. BLK & Bold\n\nChildhood friends Pernell Cezar and Rod Johnson had a lifelong series of conversations about how they could serve their communities. \u201cAfter decade-long professional careers in corporate America, we both, respectively, felt that there was a void in the business world, and we need to ensure that people in our own backyards were given equal access and resources in exchange for their patronage of this business,\u201d says Rod.\n\nThe duo founded BLK & Bold as their way of making purpose popular and leveraged the daily ritual of enjoying caffeinated beverages into a way of giving back. BLK & BOLD pledges 5% of the profits from its coffee and tea sales to youth programs.\n\nChildhood friends Pernell Cezar (left) and Rod Johnson started BLK & Bold to leverage the wholesale of coffee and tea as a way of supporting youth programs. BLK & Bold\n\nBeing one of the first Black-owned nationally distributed coffee brands carries a lot of weight for Rod and Pernell. \u201cAlthough it is humbling to serve and be in that position, it also makes us wonder why we are the first,\u201d says Rod. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been much representation as merchants by people who consume the beverage as frequently as other demographics.\u201d This platform and business model allow Rod and Pernell to support programs that enhance workforce development, eradicate food insecurities, and reduce youth homelessness.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very intentional about selecting that vulnerable demographic because of our own upbringing,\u201d says Rod. \u201cPernell and I were both raised in Gary, Indiana, in ill-resource households. And we were fortunate to have a support system around us that allowed us to overcome the obstacles that we were initially faced with.\u201d\n\nRod and Pernell are using the platform provided by BLK & Bold, one of the first Black-owned coffee and tea brands to be nationally distributed, to create social change by supporting youth programs. BLK & Bold\n\nIn addition to supporting vulnerable populations, BLK & Bold is showcasing its supply chain. When Pernell and Rod started their business journey, they were meeting suppliers directly and learning to roast coffee in their own garage. As the supply chain was always a crucial component for BLK & Bold The next area they want to shine a spotlight on is responsible farming and trading by showcasing how their coffee and tea travel from farm to cup.\n\n8. TPMOCS\n\nTPMOCS is a community of Indigenous makers who produce baby moccasins. By providing employment opportunities for Montana\u2019s Blackfeet tribe, TPMOCS aims to alleviate some of the pressures the community faces as a result of having a 69% unemployment rate.\n\n\u201cMy mom was very aware of the poverty and the challenges associated with growing up on the reservation and made a decision to move about an hour away so that we could still be close to our family but have access to better education opportunities.\u201d says TPMOCS founder Maria Fisher Running Jones, who grew up in the Blackfeet community and experienced first hand the disadvantages of living on reservations.\n\nStarting TPMOCS was a way for Maria Fisher Running Jones to support her tribe. TPMOCS\n\nFrom that turning point, Maria went onto law school and is now a practicing corporate lawyer. Even though supporting organizations that run programs for Indigenous communities is something Maria strongly believes and participates in, she wanted to create her own hands-on way of supporting her tribe.\n\n\u201cOne thing that the Blackfeet community is proud of and are quite good at is craftsmanship,\u201d says Maria. Combining the arts of moccasin-making and beading, Maria modernized designs and proposed the tribe make baby moccasins, a product that is scalable and has a shorter production time.\n\nTPMOCS is highlighting the artistry of the Blackfeet Tribe and merging it with modern designs for baby moccasins. TPMOCS\n\nSince launching in 2014, TPMOCS have gained exposure from a Facebook showcase and mentions by celebrity Nicole Richie, which led to wholesale inquiries from major retailers. \u201cWe\u2019ve struggled with a lot of growth opportunities because something has to give,\u201d says Maria. \u201cLarge companies sometimes want 50%, but I still have to pay the artisans, pay for materials, and keep the business going, and it just can\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nFor Maria, the most important thing is to support the livelihoods of artisans. Her team is working on other projects that will include merchandise that\u2019s even more scalable. In addition to donating back to the community with necessities and setting up scholarship grants, TPMOCS is looking for ways to expand its business model to other tribes, sharing Indigenous culture, and supporting more communities.\n\n9. Microsoft\n\nSoftware company Microsoft has been a socially responsible brand for quite some time. It started in the 1990s and was the first Fortune 500 company to include things like benefits for LGBTQ partners and to be concerned about sustainability.\n\nMicrosoft has actually been carbon neutral since 2012 and has committed to becoming carbon negative by 2030. Every year it releases an extensive environmental report detailing things such as the company\u2019s effect on water and ecosystems, and even the waste Microsoft generates.\n\nEven though Microsoft is a multibillion dollar company, it still focuses on individual stories like Shy Averett\u2019s.\n\nMicrosoft features Shy Averett\u2019s story of activism trying to solve the Flint water crisis. | Source: Microsoft\n\nFrom the Flint water crisis to females in male-dominated industries to transitions from military to civilian life, Microsoft tells the stories of these activists and entrepreneurs and the struggles and issues they deal with. It shows that though Microsoft may be a big company, it has not lost sight of the people who use and make its products.\n\nMicrosoft has also been a longtime supporter of diversity and inclusion in the company. In fact, in 1993, Microsoft became the first Fortune 500 company to offer same-sex domestic partnership benefits to its employees and to include sexual orientation in its corporate non-discrimination policy back.\n\nIn 2016 Microsoft doubled how many women were in vice president leadership positions. In 2017, the Black, hispanic, and latino representation in its workforce increased by 33%. And in the 2018 fiscal year, it spent $3 billion with disabled, veteran, minority, and women-owned businesses.\n\nIn every step it\u2019s taken, Microsoft has stayed true to its mission and has kept CSR at the forefront of the company\u2019s goals.\n\n10. LEGO\n\nLEGO is an abbreviation of two Danish words, \u201cleg\u201d and \u201cgodt,\u201d which together mean \u201cplay well.\u201d This has been the goal of the LEGO Group since it was founded in 1932. Its kid-centric focus now includes being a sustainable company and supporting programs so kids will have a healthy Earth in which to grow and play.\n\nLEGO is serious about becoming a sustainable company that supports creating a healthier planet for future generations. In LEGO\u2019s 2021 Sustainability report, it showed that LEGO factories expanded the company\u2019s commitment to using renewable energy by 98% compared to 2020. It also revealed that LEGO has created a prototype LEGO brick made from recycled PET plastic from bottles.\n\nLEGO has also committed to reducing its absolute carbon emissions by 37% by the year 2032. To top it all off, LEGO donated over 650,000 pounds of LEGO bricks through the LEGO Replay program to over 100,000 children in North America.\n\nIn fact, in April of 2022, the LEGO Foundation invested $20 million to support neurodivergent children. The Play for All program is designed to celebrate the strengths of these children and allow them, and all children, to play, learn, and thrive.\n\nSource: Lego\n\nLEGO\u2019s next goal is to tackle not only protecting children on the internet, but helping them flourish. LEGO has paired with UNICEF and child development experts to create tools that will empower businesses and policymakers to put the well-being of children at the center of digital design.\n\nThis project, called the Responsible Innovation in Technology for Children, studies how children play, learn, access information, build friendships, and more. It does this by giving children a voice to help track their mental, physical, and emotional status as they navigate today\u2019s digital world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Starbucks\n\nOne of the main ways Starbucks is socially responsible is through its goal to have all its coffee, tea, and cocoa be 100% ethically sourced. In its 2021 Global Environmental and Social Impact Report, it showed that it was able to get 95% of its coffee and 99% of its tea and cocoa from ethical sources. By 2030, Starbucks hopes to achieve carbon neutral green coffee.\n\nStarbucks was also able to contract over 1,200 eco-wet water mills to help conserve water usage by almost 80%, as well as have 66% of the energy it uses come from renewable energy sources.\n\nStarbucks is also invested in the farmers that provide the coffee, tea, eggs, etc. that make Starbucks run. The coffee company distributed 10 million coffee trees to local farmers worldwide in 2021. And it made a commitment to use only poultry raised without antibiotics, to stop using excessive gestation stalls for sows, and only to use cage-free eggs.\n\nSource: Starbucks\n\nStarbucks is known for its corporate responsibility toward its employees. In fact, the coffee company began to offer full health benefits to eligible full- and part-time employees, including coverage for domestic partners, in 1988. Then in the 1990s and 2000s, when health care costs soared, CEO Howard Schultz went to the White House and Congress to discuss with policy makers how health care costs were impacting all Americans.\n\n12. Ben & Jerry\u2019s\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s has never been shy about being outspoken on the social issues it supports:\n\nIn 2015, to inspire fans to join the global climate movement, it created the Save Our Swirled flavor.\n\nB&J supported the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to favor marriage equality by creating I Dough, I Dough in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, it launched the Empower Mint flavor to mark the anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling and donated a portion of the proceeds from the sale of this flavor to the North Carolina NAACP.\n\nIn 2017, Ben & Jerry\u2019s partnered with the International Rescue Committee in Europe and the UK to launch Home Sweet Honeycomb and call upon B&J fans to support legislation that would resettle refugees safely in Europe.\n\nIn 2018, Ben & Jerry\u2019s released a limited batch flavor, Pecan Resist, to encourage people not to stand quietly while disenfranchised groups are silenced and ignored.\n\nIn order to support Black Lives Matter, Ben & Jerry\u2019s created a new flavor in 2021 called Change is Brewing.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that Ben & Jerry\u2019s was one of the first companies in the world to put its social mission on equal footing to its product and fiscal missions. The ice cream giant is also the first-ever wholly owned subsidiary to gain a B Corp certification. That means it has been verified by B Lab (a non-profit company) to meet high standards of social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s B impact score for 2021 was 110 overall. To put that in context, the median score for ordinary businesses is 50.9, and an 80 qualifies a business for a B Corp certification.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s has always been active in the communities it serves. If you go to Ben & Jerry\u2019s webpage you can see articles about trans rights, LGBTQ+ rights, climate change, and racial equality. Those articles always link to organizations where you can donate, or learn more, or volunteer. Ben & Jerry\u2019s is all about helping its fans take real action to support the causes they believe in.\n\nIn its article about climate change it even links out to a website that will help visitors find a march or protest near them. For Ben & Jerry\u2019s, its CSR missions are not just an added feature to its business model, it is at the core of Ben & Jerry\u2019s identity.\n\nSource: Ben & Jerry's\n\n13. TOMS\n\nTOMS is a shoe, apparel, accessories, and eyewear company. It became known because in 2006 it started its One for One mode:. The then purely shoe company promised to give away one pair of shoes for every pair sold.\n\nThe idea behind the One for One model is that people worldwide have trouble getting to school or getting a job if they don\u2019t have a pair of shoes. So by tackling this simple problem, TOMS hoped to support larger health, education, and community development programs through various partnerships. In 2020 it reported that the company has now given away over 100 million pairs of shoes.\n\nTo add to that, TOMS aims to be environmentally sustainable. It has goals to use 100% sustainable cotton, source 100% of its packaging materials from sustainable forests, and to reduce its carbon footprint by 2025. TOMS even provides a full breakdown of the materials, where they\u2019re sourced, which suppliers and partnerships the company has, and how these materials are used for every part of a pair of TOMS earthwise products.\n\nSource: TOMS\n\nIn 2021, TOMS committed to investing one-third of the company\u2019s profits into a program it calls Grassroots Good. It gives cash grants and supports organizations that build equity in marginalized communities. That means communities of Indigenous, Black, and other people of color, as well as LGBTQ+, women, veterans, and organizations involved in gang rehabilitation and re-entry programs.\n\nTOMS supports organizations like Homeboy Industries, which supports previously incarcerated people to become contributing members of their community. | Source: TOMS\n\nGrassroots Good also supports organizations that help provide mental health resources to people who wouldn\u2019t have access to them in the US. Grassroots Good aims to support communities, individuals, and the planet we all live on.\n\nBecause of TOMS\u2019 dedication to its CSR missions, it received a 121.5 rating for its 2021 B Corp certification. And although it started off as a humble shoe company, it has now expanded to include apparel, accessories, and eyewear. TOMS is a great example of how a company dedicated to its CSR missions will expand, grow, and be successful.\n\nChange starts with the need to solve a problem\n\nThe founders of these businesses might be working in different industries and creating change in separate communities, but they all started because they wanted to solve a problem their own way. These founders might not have even envisioned being carried by large retailers or expanding internationally\u2014they took on challenges step by step and eventually created the movements they are leading today. What are some areas where you envision a change?\n\nIllustration by Luca D'Urbino"

            "search_summary": "Shopify: 3 lessons from investing $55 million in 40 carbon removal startups\u00a0\u00a0GreenBiz",
            "article_text": "Since 2019, Shopify has invested close to $55 million in 40 startups that have developed methods for removing carbon dioxide from the air \u2014 from direct air capture devices to spreading crushed rock on farmland for faster soil absorption.\n\nThose relationships are part of the $6.7 billion e-commerce company\u2019s strategy to offset its emissions without buying traditional carbon offsets. Shopify\u2019s initial bets will removed 84,400 metric tons of CO2, said Shopify head of sustainability Stacy Kauk in a mid-December update.\n\nThat\u2019s a small amount, considering the gigatons in reductions needed to slow temperature increases and the spikes in emissions caused by a company the size of Shopify. But it\u2019s almost double what Shopify reported in early 2023, and the company was part of at least four high-profile deals since May that will remove 338,000 metric tons. Those new credits will start being delivered this year.\n\nShopify\u2019s investments go through its Sustainability Fund, set up to support renewable energy procurement, green building leases near public transportation hubs and carbon sequestration that stands the test of time. The fund, with board-level approval, supports \u201cintentionally overpaying\u201d for projects that sequester carbon to boost corporate interest in the market, as Shopify CEO Tobias L\u00fctke said at the launch. Shopify is also part of Frontier, a group of corporations committing $1 billion to getting more projects off the ground.\n\n\u201cCarbon removal is a big, gnarly problem that can\u2019t be solved by Shopify and other corporate buyers alone,\u201d Kauk said in December. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our best to kickstart the market, but it will take way more than just us.\u201d\n\nGreenBiz spoke with Kauk to dig deeper into the strategy and discuss what other companies can learn from Shopify\u2019s experiments over the past four years. Here are the big takeaways.\n\n3 proof points before committing to a carbon removal project\n\nHow does Shopify know whether a successful pilot is worth scaling into a commercial project? Kauk\u2019s team uses these tests:\n\nUnderstand the financial model\n\nIs there clarity on potential maintenance costs and factors that could affect operational uptime, such as adverse weather conditions? Know the unit economics\n\nWill the facility deliver enough capacity to make an investment worthwhile? The company needs to know how the price curve for removing a ton of carbon will change between now and 2050. \u201cMake sure that it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be bankable, that\u2019s going to get capital coming in from other places, so that the facility can be built and operated,\u201d Kauk said. Will it have staying power?\n\nWill it make a meaningful impact two decades from now? That includes factors such as the potential evolution of the technology and how much physical space it requires.\n\nA big risk today: Disparate verification methodologies\n\nQuestions about the reliability and durability of claims for carbon credits centered on emissions avoidance, such as protecting tropical rainforests, have underscored the need for better verification methods and standards of carbon removal solutions. For many sustainability professionals, the high-profile controversy over claims related to a massive forest conservation project in Zimbabwe are top of mind.\n\nKauk said there is a lot of \u201cuncertainty in terms of how much is actually being removed and permanently stored. We just don\u2019t know enough yet.\u201d Some companies Shopify is working with, such as CarbonCure, which stores captured CO2 in concrete, are working with established registries, such as Verra, to develop verification methodologies. \u201cRight now, we have to do a lot of the review ourselves \u2026 we get all of the data and we check the work and compare it against the methodology, so that\u2019s not a very scalable approach at all,\u201d said Kauk.\n\nShopify is pushing for standards, such as the one published by Isometric on Dec. 21, which focus on monitoring, reporting and verifying emissions removed by direct air capture systems. Isometric is also working on verification methods for things such as enhanced rock weathering technologies.\n\nA controversial solution with huge potential: ocean capture\n\nShopify\u2019s team has considered many carbon removal techniques. One that has \u201cmassive potential\u201d is ocean alkalinity enhancement, Kauk said. This method increases the sea\u2019s alkalinity by adding minerals such as olivine and basalt to beaches or the water\u2019s surface. The chemicals convert dissolved carbon dioxide in seawater into carbonates and bicarbonates, which trap more atmospheric CO2 over long periods of time. The theory makes some scientists nervous because it is not clear whether speeding up ocean alkalinization might have harmful unintended consequences on the marine environment.\n\nShopify is working with six startups in this space including Running Tide, which grows kelp and sinks it to the seafloor to store captured carbon; Planetary Tech, which adds an alkaline solution to ocean water; and Captura, which uses electrochemistry to filter CO2 out of seawater.\n\n\u201cWe need to find a framework that makes all of the stakeholders around these kinds of projects comfortable, because we have to leverage the ocean, because it just takes away a lot of the issues that we have with other kinds of carbon removal, such as land use change [and] electricity usage,\u201d Kauk said. \u201cThose cost factors come way down when we use the ocean.\u201d\n\nRead more about Shopify\u2019s carbon removal strategy in this edited transcript of the interview."
