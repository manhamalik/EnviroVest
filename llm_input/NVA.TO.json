(\u201cGLJ\u201d) (the \u201cGLJ Report\u201d). The efficiency in growing our reserves highlights the quality of our asset base. Our proven track record of continuous improvement, combined with the substantial depth and quality of our undeveloped resources, emphasizes our ability to deliver sustained value for our shareholders in both the short and long term. Reserves replacement(1) and inventory growth are key metrics as we continue to build out infrastructure to support production levels toward 115,000 Boe/d.\n\nOur 2023 reserves report includes the following key accomplishments:\n\nReported Proved Developed Producing (\u201cPDP\u201d) reserves of 161.9 MMBoe, a year-over-year increase of 14%, or a 20% increase on a per share basis;\n\nRecorded Total Proved plus Probable (\u201cTP+PA\u201d) reserves of 643.0 MMBoe, a year-over-year increase of 6%, or a 12% increase on a per share basis, attributed to the continued success in our multi-layer Montney development, including newly booked Lower Montney locations in Gold Creek;\n\nReplaced 168% and 237% of 2023 production on a PDP and TP+PA basis, respectively, which is reflected in the continued growth of our undeveloped inventory of locations;\n\nDelivered PDP Finding and Development Costs (\u201cF&D\u201d) (1) that exceeded our expectations despite an inflationary environment, at $10.54/Boe, due to strong well performance and execution;\n\nthat exceeded our expectations despite an inflationary environment, at $10.54/Boe, due to strong well performance and execution; TP+PA F&D was $12.59/Boe, driven by an expected increase in Future Development Capital to account for infrastructure to accommodate growth to 115,000 Boe/d and a 6% increase in undeveloped well costs to reflect 2023 actuals. Three-year average TP+PA F&D is $10.30/Boe;\n\nAchieved a PDP recycle ratio (1) of 2.8x based on our 2023 operating netback (1) ;\n\nof 2.8x based on our 2023 operating netback ; Total wells increased by 47 to 353, while the total undeveloped drilling locations increased by 68 to 1180, which reflects over 25 years of development at the current pace(3); andPDP, TP, and TP+PA before-tax net present value, discounted at 10% (NPV10)(2), are $9.68, $19.52, and $27.03 per share, respectively, at December 31, 2023, reflecting the exceptional current and future underlying value of our assets.\n\nNotes: (1) Each of \u201creserve replacement\u201d, \u201cF&D costs\u201d, \u201crecycle ratio\u201d and \u201coperating netback\u201d are non-GAAP financial ratios.

Reference should be made to the section entitled \u201cNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\u201d in this press release. (3) Total undeveloped locations include 336 undeveloped proved plus probable drilling locations and 844 undeveloped contingent resource drilling locations.\n\nThe detailed summary of our year end 2023 reserves disclosure and other oil and gas information is included below, and further information will be included in our Annual Information Form which will be filed on or before March 29, 2024 on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nExcellence in Operations\n\nOperations through the end of 2023 and now into the first two months of 2024 continue to exceed our expectations. The consistency in our service providers has been one of the keys to the continued improvements we are seeing across all aspects of our field operations. Our two drilling rigs finished tandem-drilling a six-well pad in Elmworth and are now drilling a 4-well pad in Pipestone and a 4-well pad in Gold Creek. Completion operations are also progressing very well and we expect six additional pads to come on-stream this year. Despite the severe cold experienced in late January, continued performance improvements and some continued savings on the materials side have allowed us to meet budgeted well costs year to date.\n\nInfrastructure debottlenecking and expansion projects are progressing well in 2024 at both NuVista and third-party facilities. In the Wapiti area an expansion of the NuVista Elmworth Compressor Station is ongoing through the first half of 2024 with a start up planned for early in the third quarter. Additionally, a debottleneck project is being executed at the third-party Pembina Gas Infrastructure (PGI) Wapiti gas plant in the first quarter. These projects will enhance corporate facility capacity, in stages, to over 95,000 Boe/d. Concurrently, in the Pipestone North area, construction is well underway at the third-party CSV Midstream Albright gas plant with anticipated start up in late 2024 or early 2025. Once online NuVista\u2019s facility capacity is expected to reach a corporate total of approximately 105,000 Boe/d.\n\nCycle time improvements have been impressive. Since our 2019-2020 program we have reduced the average number of days from the start of drilling to the on-stream date by 54%. This has significant impact to the rate of return for projects that reach payout in less than one year.\n\nOne of the most significant performance highlights continues to be the 6-well pad at Gold Creek that was brought on-stream in the fourth quarter of 2023. Notably, this is our first fully co-developed pad in Gold Creek, including 3 wells from the Middle Montney layer plus 3 wells from the emerging Lower Montney layer. In February, this pad reached its IP90 milestone of 1,570 Boe/d on average per well, including 50% condensate, which represents nearly 90% more condensate produced over its IP90 compared to the Gold Creek historical average well result. A strong production result combined with continued progress in execution which created record NuVista drilling performance on this pad, is forecast to result in a first year capital efficiency of less than $8,000 per flowing Boe \u2013 a leading result for the area.\n\nBalance Sheet Strength and Return of Capital to Shareholders\n\nWe ended the year in a position of low debt and significant financial flexibility. At December 31, 2023, our net debt was $183.6 million, well below our soft ceiling of approximately $350 million. We were minimally drawn on our $450 million covenant-based credit facility, at $16.9 million, with a net debt to annualized fourth quarter adjusted funds flow ratio of 0.2x. The net debt ceiling ensures that based on current production levels, our net debt to adjusted funds flow ratio remains at or below 1.0x in a stress test price environment of US$45/Bbl WTI oil and US$2.00/MMBtu NYMEX natural gas.\n\nWe remain focused on our disciplined and value-adding growth strategy, and providing significant shareholder returns. We continue to believe that the best method for return of capital to shareholders is initially to repurchase shares, however we will continue to re-evaluate over the next year as our growth plan proceeds. This evaluation will consider commodity prices, the economic and tax environment, and will include all options including share repurchases and dividend payments.\n\nPresently, our Board has set a target of returning approximately 75% of free adjusted funds flow to shareholders through the repurchase of the Company\u2019s common shares pursuant to our current NCIB. The remaining free adjusted funds flow can be allocated towards debt reduction, land acquisitions, infrastructure repurchases, or selective mergers and acquisitions that add value for shareholders.\n\nEnvironment, Social & Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) Highlights\n\nIn September 2023, we proudly published our 2022 ESG Report, underscoring our accomplishments in achieving specific targets and advancing ongoing projects to support our commitment to ESG objectives. Notably, in 2022, we exceeded expectations by achieving a 34% reduction in CO 2 e emission intensity from our 2020 baseline, far surpassing our target of a 20% reduction by 2025. Additionally, our methane emission intensity decreased by 86% compared to our 2012 benchmark. As part of our ongoing commitment to enhance our emissions performance, the newly commissioned cogeneration unit at our Wembley Gas Plant in the Pipestone area became operational in the fourth quarter of 2023. This initiative aligns with our broader social responsibility efforts to contribute positively to the communities in which we reside and operate. Notably, the cogeneration unit received support from five Indigenous Nations, who are entitled to defined contractual cash flows, while NuVista will benefit from the cogeneration unit in terms of reduced operating costs and carbon emissions. We also progressed in a number of social and governance matters. More details are available in our 2023 management discussion and analysis and our 2022 ESG report. The 2022 ESG Report is available and can be accessed on our Company\u2019s website (see www.nuvistaenergy.com ).\n\nExecutive Staff Announcement\n\nNuVista is pleased to announce the appointment of Michael Lawford, currently Chief Operating Officer, to President & Chief Operating Officer, effective immediately.\n\nMr. Lawford joined NuVista in 2012 in the role of Vice President Development, and in 2017, he was promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Lawford played a pivotal role in transforming the Company into the leading pure-play Montney producer that NuVista is recognized as today. He continues to be a central leader in advancing NuVista\u2019s strategic priorities and operational success. Mr. Lawford holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology from the University of Alberta and is a member of the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists, and Geophysicists of Alberta. Prior to joining NuVista, Mr. Lawford held various roles, including leading the North American New Plays group at a large Canadian independent oil and gas firm.\n\nWe offer our warmest congratulations to Mr. Lawford as he takes this next step in the Company\u2019s long-term succession plan. Jonathan Wright will continue in the role of Chief Executive Officer.\n\n2024 Guidance Update\n\nAs demonstrated above, we continue to execute according to our plans, with well and facility outperformance in several areas. Production is tracking ahead of plan, and as a result we expect to land near the top of our first quarter 2024 production guidance range of 77,000 \u2013 80,000 Boe/d. We expect volumes to reach over 90,000 Boe/d at some point in the second half of 2024.\n\nOur outlook for the full year of 2024 still anticipates excellent well economics with sub one-year payouts, and significant free adjusted funds flow net of capital expenditures despite the temporary significant reduction in natural gas prices. As our adjusted funds flow is primarily driven by condensate pricing, we are making no changes to our capital plans at this time, which allow us to maintain the efficiencies of steady 2-drill-rig execution. We re-affirm our 2024 full year production and capital expenditure guidance ranges of 83,000 \u2013 87,000 Boe/d and $500 million.\n\nWe intend to continue our track record of carefully directing free adjusted funds flow towards a prudent balance of return to shareholders and debt reduction, while investing in disciplined production growth towards 115,000 Boe/d. NuVista has top quality assets and a management team focused on relentless improvement. We have the necessary foundation and liquidity to continue adding significant value for our shareholders.

The calculation for F&D costs includes all exploration and development capital for that period as outlined in the Company\u2019s year-end financial statements plus the change in future development capital for that period. This total capital including the change in the future development capital is then divided by the change in reserves for that period including revisions for that same period. The aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during the year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserve additions for the year. FD&A costs are calculated in the same manner except in addition to exploration and development capital and the change in future development capital, acquisition capital (net of any disposition proceeds) is also included in the calculation.\n\nSummary of Corporate Net Present Value Data of Future Net Revenue\n\nThe estimated net present values of future net revenue before income taxes associated with NuVista\u2019s reserves effective December 31, 2023 and based on the published 3 Consultants\u2019 Average price forecast as at January 1, 2024 as set forth below, are summarized in the following table:\n\nBefore Income Taxes Discount Factor (%/year) Reserves category (1)(2) ($ thousands) 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% Proved Developed producing 3,359,306 2,518,100 2,010,245 1,683,220 1,458,573 Developed non\u2011producing 484,705 352,217 277,661 230,826 198,755 Undeveloped 4,350,139 2,644,846 1,764,108 1,252,617 927,660 Total proved 8,194,151 5,515,164 4,052,014 3,166,663 2,584,989 Probable 6,090,431 2,803,913 1,559,783 989,124 685,752 Total proved plus probable 14,284,581 8,319,077 5,611,797 4,155,786 3,270,741\n\nNOTES: (1) Numbers may not add due to rounding.

(2) Exchange rate used to generate the benchmark reference prices in this table. (3) NuVista\u2019s future realized gas prices are forecasted based on a combination of various benchmark prices in addition to the AECO benchmark in order to reflect the favorable price diversification to other markets which NuVista has undertaken. Pricing at these markets has been accounted for in the GLJ Report. Additional information on NuVista\u2019s gas marketing diversification will be available in our corporate presentation.\n\nAdvisories Regarding Oil and Gas Information\n\nBOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 Bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.\n\nThis press release contains a number of oil and gas metrics prepared by management, including F&D costs, FD&A costs, recycle ratio, operating netback, corporate netback and reserves replacement costs, which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate NuVista\u2019s performance on a comparable basis with prior periods; however, such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of NuVista, and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods. Details of how F&D costs, FD&A costs, operating netback, corporate netback and recycle ratios are calculated are set forth under the heading \u201cNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures \u2013 Non-GAAP Ratios\u201d. Reserves replacement is calculated as reserves divided by estimated production.\n\nAny references in this press release to initial production (\u201cIP\u201d) rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however, such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will continue production and decline thereafter. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for NuVista.\n\nAny reference to capital efficiency has been prepared by management and is used to measure performance. NuVista calculates capital efficiency as the sum of the capital expenditures divided by average first year production rate for the applicable well(s). This term does not have a standardized meaning or standard calculation and is not comparable to similar measures used by other entities.\n\nThis press release discloses NuVista\u2019s potential drilling locations in two categories: (i) undeveloped proved plus probable (2P) drilling locations; and (ii) undeveloped contingent resources (2C) drilling locations. Undeveloped 2P drilling locations are derived the GLJ Report, and account for undeveloped drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Undeveloped 2C drilling locations are derived from a report prepared by GLJ evaluating NuVista\u2019s contingent resources as of December 31, 2023 (\u201cGLJ Contingent Resource Report\u201d), and account for undeveloped drilling locations that have associated contingent resources based on a best estimate of such contingent resources. There is no certainty that we will drill all drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas production. The drilling locations on which we actually drill wells will ultimately depend upon the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, oil and natural gas prices, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors. Contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Economic contingent resources are those contingent resources that are currently economically recoverable. The sub-classes included under economic contingent resources are Development Pending CR, Development on Hold CR, and Development Unclarified CR. Development Pending are resources where resolution of the final conditions for development is being actively pursued (high chance of development). Development on Hold are resources where there is a reasonable chance of development but there are major non-technical contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the control of the operator. Development Unclarified are resources where the evaluation is incomplete and there is ongoing activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties. Development Not Viable are resources that are not viable in the conditions prevailing at the effective date of the evaluation, and where no further data acquisition or evaluation is currently planned and hence there is a low chance of development. In the case of the contingent resources estimated in the GLJ Contingent Resource Report, contingencies include: (i) further delineation of interest lands; (ii) corporate commitment, and; (iii) final development plan. To further delineate interest lands additional wells must be drilled and tested to demonstrate commercial rates on the resource lands. Reserves are only assigned in close proximity to demonstrated productivity. As continued delineation drilling occurs, a portion of the contingent resources are expected to be reclassified as reserves. Confirmation of corporate intent to proceed with remaining capital expenditures within a reasonable timeframe is a requirement for the assessment of reserves. Finalization of a development plan includes timing, infrastructure spending and the commitment of capital.\n\nThe estimated future net revenue contained in this press release does not necessarily represent the fair market value of the reserves. There is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions contained in the GLJ Report will be attained and variations could be material. The recovery and reserve estimates described herein are estimates only. Actual reserves may be greater or less than those calculated.\n\nDefinitions of Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nReserves are estimated remaining quantities of crude oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be recoverable from known accumulations, as of a given date, based on the analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical, and engineering data; the use of established technology; and specified economic conditions, which are generally accepted as being reasonable. Reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates as follows:\n\nProved Reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves.\n\nProbable Reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.\n\nBasis of presentation\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the financial data presented in this news release has been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) also known as IFRS Accounting Standards.\n\nNatural gas liquids are defined by National Instrument 51-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities\u201d to include ethane, butane, propane, pentanes plus and condensate. Unless explicitly stated in this press release, references to \u201cNGL\u201d refers only to ethane, butane and propane and references to \u201ccondensate\u201d refers to only to condensate and pentanes plus. NuVista has disclosed condensate and pentanes plus values separately from ethane, butane and propane values as NuVista believes it provides a more accurate description of NuVista\u2019s operations and results therefrom.\n\nProduction split for Boe/d amounts referenced in the news release are as follows:\n\nReference Total Boe/d\n\nNatural Gas\n\n% Condensate\n\n% NGLs\n\n% Q4 2023 production \u2013 actual 85,924 60 % 31 % 9 % Q4 2023 production guidance 82,000 \u2013 84,000 61 % 30 % 9 % 2023 annual production \u2013 actual 77,185 60 % 32 % 8 % 2023 annual production guidance 76,000 \u2013 77,000 61 % 30 % 9 % Q1 2024 production guidance 77,000 \u2013 80,000 61 % 30 % 9 % 2024 annual production guidance 83,000 \u2013 87,000 61 % 30 % 9 %\n\nReserves advisories\n\nThe GLJ Report was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (\u201cCOGE Handbook\u201d) and is dated effective as of December 31, 2023. The GLJ Report was based on 3 Consultants\u2019 Average January 1, 2024 forecast pricing and foreign exchange rates at January 1, 2024. All reserves information has been presented on a gross basis, which is the Company\u2019s working interest share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty interests of the Company. The reserves have been categorized accordance with the reserves definitions as set out in the COGE Handbook. The recovery and reserve estimates contained herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered.\n\nAdvisory regarding forward-looking information and statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d) within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

NuVista has included the FOFI in order to provide readers with a more complete perspective on NuVista\u2019s future operations and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.\n\nThese forward-looking statements and FOFI are made as of the date of this press release and NuVista disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements and FOFI, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, other than as required by applicable securities law.\n\nNon-GAAP and other financial measures\n\nThis press release uses various specified financial measures (as such terms are defined in National Instrument 52-112 \u2013 Non-GAAP Disclosure and Other Financial Measures Disclosure (\u201cNI 51-112\u201c)) including \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d, \u201cnon-GAAP ratios\u201d, \u201ccapital management measures\u201d and \u201csupplementary financial measures\u201d (as such terms are defined in NI 51-112), which are described in further detail below. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors and shareholders as the measures provide increased transparency and the ability to better analyze performance against prior periods on a comparable basis.\n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measures\n\nNI 52-112 defines a non-GAAP financial measure as a financial measure that: (i) depicts the historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flow of an entity; (ii) with respect to its composition, excludes an amount that is included in, or includes an amount that is excluded from, the composition of the most directly comparable financial measure disclosed in the primary financial statements of the entity; (iii) is not disclosed in the financial statements of the entity; and (iv) is not a ratio, fraction, percentage or similar representation.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized financial measures under IFRS Accounting Standards and might not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used. Investors are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as alternatives to or more meaningful than the most directly comparable GAAP measures as indicators of NuVista\u2019s performance. Set forth below are descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release.\n\nNuVista has added the non-GAAP financial measures of \u201cnet capital expenditures\u201d and \u201cnet operating expense\u201d during the year. Net capital expenditures includes proceeds received on property dispositions which will be reinvested into the Company\u2019s development plans and funds used to acquire properties. The use of net capital expenditures more closely aligns with the most directly comparable GAAP measure of cash used in investing activities and incorporates funds reinvested from property dispositions which more accurately reflects the Company\u2019s strategic plan. The fourth quarter of 2023 was the first instance in which NuVista recognized power generation expenditures, which were in respect of the cogeneration unit at the Wembley Gas Plant. Net operating expense considers that any incremental gross costs incurred to process third party volumes at its facilities are offset by the applicable fees charged to such third parties. The use of net operating expense closely aligns with the most directly comparable GAAP measure of operating expense and includes other income which more actually reflects the nature of the Company\u2019s operating activities.\n\nFree adjusted funds flow\n\nFree adjusted funds flow is adjusted funds flow less net capital expenditures, power generation expenditures, and asset retirement expenditures. Each of the components of free adjusted funds flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to disclosures under the headings \u201cCapital management measures\u201d and \u201cNet capital expenditures\u201d for a description of each component of free adjusted funds flow. Management uses free adjusted funds flow as a measure of the efficiency and liquidity of its business, measuring its funds available for additional capital allocation to manage debt levels, pay dividends, and return capital to shareholders. By removing the impact of current period net capital expenditures, power generation expenditures and asset retirement expenditures, management believes this measure provides an indication of the funds the Company has available for future capital allocation decisions.\n\nThe following table sets out our free adjusted funds flow compared to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities for the applicable periods:\n\nThree months ended December 31 Year ended December 31 ($ thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Cash provided by operating activities 211,761 226,688 721,342 844,816 Cash used in investing activities (132,646 ) (79,310 ) (531,586 ) (442,091 ) Excess cash provided by operating activities over cash used in investing activities 79,115 147,378 189,756 402,725 Adjusted funds flow 201,987 256,983 756,943 892,801 Net capital expenditures (113,258 ) (72,743 ) (518,294 ) (419,476 ) Power generation expenditures (16,904 ) \u2014 (16,904 ) \u2014 Asset retirement expenditures (1,208 ) (1,223 ) (11,195 ) (9,302 ) Free adjusted funds flow 70,617 183,017 210,550 464,023\n\nCapital expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures are equal to cash used in investing activities, excluding changes in non-cash working capital, other asset expenditures, power generation expenditures, proceeds on property dispositions and costs of acquisitions. NuVista considers capital expenditures to represent its organic capital program and a useful measure of cash flow used for capital reinvestment.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measure of capital expenditures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of cash used in investing activities for the applicable periods:\n\nThree months ended December 31 Year ended December 31 ($ thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Cash used in investing activities (132,646 ) (79,310 ) (531,586 ) (442,091 ) Changes in non-cash working capital 2,484 6,567 (13,112 ) 22,615 Other asset expenditures \u2014 \u2014 9,500 \u2014 Power generation expenditures 16,904 \u2014 16,904 \u2014 Property acquisition 44,000 \u2014 44,000 \u2014 Proceeds on property disposition \u2014 \u2014 (26,000 ) \u2014 Capital expenditures (69,258 ) (72,743 ) (500,294 ) (419,476 )\n\nNet capital expenditures\n\nNet capital expenditures are equal to cash used in investing activities, excluding changes in non-cash working capital, other asset expenditures, and power generation expenditures. The Company includes funds used for property acquisition or proceeds from property dispositions within net capital expenditures as these transactions are part of its development plans. NuVista considers net capital expenditures to represent its organic capital program inclusive of capital spending for acquisition and disposition proposes and a useful measure of cash flow used for capital reinvestment.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measure of net capital expenditures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of cash used in investing activities for the applicable periods:\n\nThree months ended December 31 Year ended December 31 ($ thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Cash used in investing activities (132,646 ) (79,310 ) (531,586 ) (442,091 ) Changes in non-cash working capital 2,484 6,567 (13,112 ) 22,615 Other asset expenditures \u2014 \u2014 9,500 \u2014 Power generation expenditures 16,904 \u2014 16,904 \u2014 Net capital expenditures (113,258 ) (72,743 ) (518,294 ) (419,476 )\n\nThe following table provides a breakdown of capital expenditures, net capital expenditures and power generation expenditures by category for the applicable periods:\n\nThree months ended December 31 Year ended December 31 ($ thousands, except % amounts) 2023 % of\n\ntotal 2022 % of\n\ntotal 2023 % of\n\ntotal 2022 % of\n\ntotal Land and retention costs 15 \u2014 20 \u2014 7,507 2 3,378 1 Geological and geophysical 249 \u2014 139 \u2014 691 \u2014 386 \u2014 Drilling and completion 51,413 74 61,348 84 392,663 79 345,735 83 Facilities and equipment 16,193 23 9,882 14 93,252 19 64,386 15 Corporate and other 1,388 2 1,354 2 6,181 1 5,591 1 Capital expenditures 69,258 72,743 500,294 419,476 Property acquisitions 44,000 \u2014 44,000 \u2014 Proceeds on property disposition \u2014 \u2014 (26,000 ) \u2014 Net capital expenditures 113,258 72,743 518,294 419,476 Power generation expenditures 16,904 \u2014 16,904 \u2014\n\nNet operating expense\n\nNuVista considers that any incremental gross costs incurred to process third party volumes at its facilities are offset by the applicable fees charged to such third parties. However, under IFRS Accounting Standards, NuVista is required to reflect operating costs and processing fee income separately on its consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated income. Management believes that net operating expense, calculated as gross operating expense less processing income and other recoveries, which are included in other income on the statement of income and comprehensive income, is a meaningful measure for investors to understand the net impact of the Company\u2019s operating activities.\n\nThe following table sets out net operating expense compared to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of operating expenses for the applicable periods:\n\nThree months ended December 31 Year ended December 31 ($ thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Operating expense 85,207 81,570 324,196 292,568 Other income (1,038 ) \u2014 (3,058 ) \u2014 Net operating expense 84,169 81,570 321,138 292,568\n\n(2) Non-GAAP ratios\n\nNI 52-112 defines a non-GAAP ratio as a financial measure that: (i) is in the form of a ratio, fraction, percentage or similar representation; (ii) has a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components; and (iii) is not disclosed in the financial statements of the entity. Set forth below is a description of the non-GAAP ratios used in this press release.\n\nThese non-GAAP ratios are not standardized financial measures under IFRS Accounting Standards and might not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used. Investors are cautioned that these ratios should not be construed as alternatives to or more meaningful than the most directly comparable GAAP measures as indicators of NuVista\u2019s performance.\n\nPer Boe disclosures for petroleum and natural gas revenues, realized gains/losses on financial derivatives, royalties, transportation expense, G&A expense, financing costs, and DD&A expense are non-GAAP ratios that are calculated by dividing each of these respective GAAP measures by NuVista\u2019s total production volumes for the period.\n\nNon-GAAP ratios presented on a \u201cper Boe\u201d basis may also be considered to be supplementary financial measures (as such term is defined in NI 51-112).\n\nOperating netback and corporate netback (\u201cnetbacks\u201d), per Boe NuVista calculated netbacks per Boe by dividing the netbacks by total production volumes sold in the period. Each of operating netback and corporate netback are non-GAAP financial measures. Operating netback is calculated as petroleum and natural gas revenues including realized financial derivative gains/losses, less royalties, transportation expense and net operating expense. Corporate netback is operating netback less general and administrative expense, cash share-based compensation expense, financing costs excluding accretion expense, and current income tax expense (recovery).\n\n\n\nManagement believes both operating and corporate netbacks are key industry benchmarks and measures of operating performance for NuVista that assists management and investors in assessing NuVista\u2019s profitability, and are commonly used by other petroleum and natural gas producers. The measurement on a Boe basis assists management and investors with evaluating NuVista\u2019s operating performance on a comparable basis.\n\n\n\nNet operating expense, per Boe NuVista has calculated net operating expense per Boe by dividing net operating expense by NuVista\u2019s production volumes for the period.Management believes that net operating expense, calculated as gross operating expense less processing income and other recoveries, which are included in other income on the statement of income and comprehensive income, is a meaningful measure for investors to understand the net impact of the Company\u2019s operating activities. The measurement on a Boe basis assists management and investors with evaluating NuVista\u2019s operating performance on a comparable basis.\n\nReference has been also been made to certain terms that do not have standardized meanings or standard calculations and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other entities. These terms are used by NuVista\u2019s management to measure the success of replacing reserves and to compare operating performance to previous periods on a comparable basis\n\nF&D costs NuVista calculated F&D costs as the sum of development costs plus the change in future development costs (\u201cFDC\u201d) for the period when appropriate, divided by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category, excluding those reserves acquired or disposed.\n\n\n\nNuVista calculated TP+PA 3-year average F&D costs as the sum of development costs plus the sum of the change in FDC over the last three completed financial years, divided by the sum of the change in the total proved and probable reserves over the last three completed financial years.\n\n\n\nFD&A costs NuVista calculated FD&A costs are calculated as the sum of development costs plus acquisition costs net of disposition proceeds plus the change in FDC for the period when appropriate, divided by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category, inclusive of changes due to acquisitions and dispositions.\n\nRecycle Ratio NuVista calculates recycle ratio as the operating netback divided by F&D costs for the applicable period.\n\n(3) Capital management measures\n\nNI 52-112 defines a capital management measure as a financial measure that: (i) is intended to enable an individual to evaluate an entity\u2019s objectives, policies and processes for managing the entity\u2019s capital; (ii) is not a component of a line item disclosed in the primary financial statements of the entity; (iii) is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of the entity; and (iv) is not disclosed in the primary financial statements of the entity.\n\nNuVista has defined net debt, adjusted funds flow, and net debt to annualized fourth quarter adjusted funds flow ratio as capital management measures used by the Company in this press release.\n\nAdjusted funds flow\n\nNuVista considers adjusted funds flow to be a key measure that provides a more complete understanding of the Company\u2019s ability to generate cash flow necessary to finance capital expenditures, expenditures on asset retirement obligations, and meet its financial obligations. NuVista has calculated adjusted funds flow based on cash flow provided by operating activities, excluding changes in non-cash working capital and asset retirement expenditures, as management believes the timing of collection, payment, and occurrence is variable and by excluding them from the calculation, management is able to provide a more meaningful performance measure of NuVista\u2019s operations on a continuing basis. More specifically, expenditures on asset retirement obligations may vary from period to period depending on the Company\u2019s capital programs and the maturity of its operating areas, while environmental remediation recovery relates to an incident that management doesn\u2019t expect to occur on a regular basis. The settlement of asset retirement obligations is managed through NuVista\u2019s capital budgeting process which considers its available adjusted funds flow.\n\nA reconciliation of adjusted funds flow is presented in the following table:\n\nThree months ended December 31 Year ended December 31 2023 2022 2023 2022 Cash provided by operating activities $ 211,761 $ 226,688 $ 721,342 $ 844,816 Asset retirement expenditures 1,208 1,223 11,195 9,302 Change in non-cash working capital (10,982 ) 29,072 24,406 38,683 Adjusted funds flow $ 201,987 $ 256,983 $ 756,943 $ 892,801\n\nNet debt\n\nNet debt is used by management to provide a more complete understanding of the NuVista\u2019s capital structure and provides a key measure to assess the Company\u2019s liquidity. NuVista has calculated net debt based on cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, other receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, long-term debt (credit facility) and senior unsecured notes and other liabilities. NuVista calculated annualized fourth quarter adjusted funds flow ratio by dividing net debt by the annualized adjusted funds flow for the fourth quarter.\n\nThe following is a summary of total market capitalization, net debt, annualized current quarter adjusted funds flow, net debt to annualized current quarter adjusted funds flow, adjusted funds flow, and net debt to adjusted funds flow:\n\n2023 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ \u2014 $ (41,890 ) Accounts receivable and prepaid expenses (163,987 ) (194,128 ) Inventory (20,705 ) (9,613 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 157,711 185,129 Current portion of other liabilities 14,082 15,375 Long-term debt (credit facility) 16,897 \u2014 Senior unsecured notes 162,195 215,392 Other liabilities 17,358 1,540 Net debt $ 183,551 $ 171,805 Annualized current quarter adjusted funds flow $ 807,948 $ 1,027,932 Net debt to annualized current quarter adjusted funds flow 0.2 0.2 Adjusted funds flow $ 756,943 $ 892,801 Net debt to adjusted funds flow 0.2 0.2\n\n(4) Supplementary financial measures\n\nThis press release may contain certain supplementary financial measures. NI 52-112 defines a supplementary financial measure as a financial measure that: (i) is intended to be disclosed on a periodic basis to depict the historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flow of an entity; (ii) is not disclosed in the financial statements of the entity; (iii) is not a non-GAAP financial measure; and (iv) is not a non-GAAP ratio.\n\nNuVista calculates: (i) \u201cadjusted funds flow per share\u201d by dividing adjusted funds flow for a period by the number of weighted average common shares of NuVista for the specified period; (ii) \u201coperating netback per share\u201d by dividing operating netback for a period by the number of weighted average common shares of NuVista for the specified period; (iii) \u201ccorporate netback per share\u201d by dividing operating netback for a period by the number of weighted average common shares of NuVista for the specified period; (iv) \u201cnet debt to adjusted funds flow\u201d by dividing the net debt at the end of a period by the adjusted funds flow for such period; and (v) \u201cnet present value per share\u201d is the net present value (discounted at 10%) in the reserve category divided by the basic common shares outstanding at the end of the period."

            "article_text": "Tourmaline Oil Corp. shares jumped 15 per cent on Friday after it said it will spin off some of its assets into a royalty and energy infrastructure company worth $775-million, with the aim of taking it public.\n\nTourmaline will own 75 per cent to 81 per cent of the new entity, called Topaz Energy Corp., and unnamed private investors will own the remainder, paying $150-million to $200-million for their stake. The company said it could launch an initial public offering for the unit next year.\n\nShares in Tourmaline surged $1.66 to $12.38 on the Toronto Stock Exchange as investors applauded chief executive Mike Rose\u2019s plan to help the market recognize value not currently reflected in the company\u2019s stock price. The move comes after a more than 50 per cent drop in the stock in the past six months.\n\nTopaz\u2019s assets will initially comprise a gross overriding royalty on all of Tourmaline\u2019s oil and gas production, a 45-per-cent interest in two of its natural gas plants and a portion of third-party revenue from gas processing.\n\nTourmaline is among several natural gas producers that have been hit by depressed prices for the fuel through the spring and summer, and waning investor interest in the sector as a whole. Last month, eight energy companies were dropped from the S&P/TSX Composite Index because their market value had dropped below the required threshold. They were Birchcliff Energy Ltd., Ensign Energy Services Inc., Kelt Exploration Ltd., NuVista Energy Ltd., NexGen Energy Ltd., Precision Drilling Corp., Peyto Exploration & Development Corp. and Torc Oil & Gas Ltd.\n\nThe creation of Topaz, known as a drop-down, shows energy companies are looking for ways to shake the funk that enveloped even those producers considered to be well run with manageable debt, such as Tourmaline. It\u2019s in the same vein as two similar spin-offs by U.S. Permian oil producer Diamondback Energy Corp. \u2013 Viper Energy Partners LP, which acquired mineral interests from Diamondback; and Rattler Midstream LP, which bought infrastructure assets. Rattler completed a US$632-million IPO in May.\n\n\u201cThey have to evaluate it, because there\u2019s zero differentiation between the stocks,\u201d said Robert Fitzmartyn, analyst at GMP FirstEnergy. \u201cCompanies with long-life inventories [of gas reserves] are trading at the same levels as those without that. We keep hearing that the market wants consolidation but the ones that deserve to be the acquirers, the superior deployers of capital, don\u2019t have a cost of capital to do so, so they need to explore alternative avenues.\u201d\n\nMr. Fitzmartyn, who rates Tourmaline as a buy, increased his 12-month target price to $23.25 from $21. He SAID Topaz\u2019s equity value could be assessed in public markets at more than $1-billion, if investors assign similar financial metrics as royalty and energy infrastructure companies receive, such as PrairieSky Royalty Ltd. or Keyera Corp.\n\nTourmaline said it will use cash proceeds, estimated at $135-million to $185-million for potential acquisitions in its main operating areas, as well as debt reduction and to buy back shares. The transaction is also expected to boost its forecast cash flow per share by 5 per cent, it said.\n\n\u201cOverall we view this event positively, with the company demonstrating clear hidden asset value from its infrastructure and large asset base not currently reflected by the market in its equity valuation,\u201d AltaCorp Capital Inc. analyst Patrick O\u2019Rourke wrote in a research note.\n\nYour time is valuable.
