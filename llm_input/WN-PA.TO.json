            "article_text": "Food prices have experienced unprecedented increases in recent times. Simultaneously, grocers are facing allegations of capitalizing on inflation to generate unjustifiable profits. Escalating expenses and a lack of transparency have engendered heightened consumer skepticism. This perceived presence of barriers and excessive profitability gives rise to ethical concerns. Our case study delves into the ethical landscape surrounding Canadian grocers, aiming to probe the public\u2019s demand for accountability. To comprehend the factors responsible for the transformation in consumer perception of Canadian grocers in 2022, we conducted an analysis utilizing data from consumers, corporate watchdogs, and industry sources. We extended the paradox perspective on corporate sustainability framework to include a historical aspect to use as our analytical lens. This study sheds light on the alterations in circumstances that have led Canadian consumers to question entire industries and accounting practices that were previously considered unproblematic. As a remedy, we recommend the establishment of a mandatory code of conduct for grocers and an enhancement in the transparency of financial reporting. Paradoxically, corporate profits may continue to grow when societal needs are no longer perceived as being neglected or, even worse, exploited.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCommodity prices are surging at levels unprecedented in decades. Consequently, political analysts are attributing this phenomenon to Canada\u2019s major supermarket chains, alleging their engagement in \u201cGreedflation\u201d\u2014which can be defined as the deliberate exploitation of inflationary trends to generate excessive profits (1). \u201cGreedflation\u201d pertains to the perception that soaring prices are driven by unjustifiable or morally questionable factors. Simultaneously, food inflation has reached historic highs. All three major Canadian grocers outperformed their average performance, with one grocer having its best year ever (3). Does this mean Canadian grocers are guilty of \u201cGreedflation\u201d?\n\nSome may contend that corporate profits are ethically contentious, as they represent the residual ownership share enabling the accumulation of passive income among the ownership class. Further, Svanberg and Svanberg (4) advocate that \u201cto the degree, business ethics shares the conventional perspective, it will face a problem justifying the crux of business; the bottom line.\u201d As labor is required to produce residual income for the owner class, the passive income for one individual represents the lost wages of another.\n\nIn their paper, Svanberg and Svanberg (4) revealed that conventional ethics may deem only the means of conducting business as potentially morally justifiable, while not necessarily extending the same ethical judgment to the profits generated. Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that disentangling profits from the business itself may present significant practical challenges. Lee (5) advocates for the implementation of policies aimed at enabling firms to maximize their appropriation of the positive externalities arising from their innovations. This approach is intended to enhance the incentives for prospective innovators. It is plausible to argue that corporate profitability plays a pivotal role in driving innovation, even in critical domains such as food safety.\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider a contrasting scenario where market conditions are characterized by reduced income levels and limited resources for investment and profit accumulation. In such circumstances, low and middle-income countries may find themselves grappling with foodborne diseases stemming from the consumption of fresh perishable foods, particularly those sold within informal markets.\n\nThe connection between corporate profit and innovation is multifaceted, with implications extending beyond conventional economic metrics. By fostering an environment in which firms can effectively harness the positive externalities of their innovations, policymakers can bolster the impetus for future advancements, which may include critical areas like food safety. Conversely, in markets where profit margins are constrained, there exists a heightened risk of suboptimal outcomes, as exemplified by the prevalence of foodborne illnesses in less affluent regions (6).\n\nThe moral landscape is a concept that \u201caddresses the interrelationship between landscapes and moral values and judgments\u201d [(7), 191], and is \u201ca hypothetical space representing human well-being [\u2026] where the peaks of this landscape are the heights of prosperity, and the valleys represent human suffering\u201d (8) [as cited in Diller and Nuzzolilli (9), 266]. This paper uses the term \u201cmoral landscape\u201d in conjunction with paradox perspective on corporate sustainability framework of Hahn et al. (10) to analyze the peaks and valleys of Canadian grocers and their stakeholders.\n\nCanada employs a mixed-market system primarily characterized by free-market principles. However, the federal government does exercise control over certain services, such as postal and air traffic control. Additionally, the Canadian system exhibits certain features akin to a socialist system, exemplified by the provision of retirement benefits and universal healthcare coverage (11). A free-market system, also known as capitalism, is characterized by the ownership and operation of most businesses by individuals who possess their assets and retain their post-tax profits (ibid). However, in the current context of soaring food prices, ethical concerns have emerged regarding the sale of food and the practices of Canadian grocers. There is a lack of consensus regarding an acceptable profit threshold within this sector. In the broader business landscape, corporate leadership remains divided on what constitutes ethical conduct when it comes to earnings management (12).\n\nThree major companies dominate Canadian food distribution to consumers (13). These companies operate diverse businesses that encompass food reporting, apparel, beauty, health (including pharmaceuticals), and other general merchandize, all consolidated within a single category. Present reporting standards allow companies with operations sharing similarities in nature, production, or sales to aggregate their financial data. Consequently, this practice renders it challenging, if not entirely unfeasible, to accurately assess profitability solely based on food sales. In the context of an investor call with financial analysts, one president of a grocery chain attributed their increased margins to higher-margin products such as fragrances. When a member of the media sought validation of the grocer\u2019s statement from an accounting professor, the professor indicated that it was impossible to either confirm or refute the statement using the publicly available information in the financial statements (14). Without greater transparency, it remains challenging to determine whether Canadian grocers have engaged in consumer price gouging.\n\nThe escalation in prices and the absence of transparency have contributed to a heightened sense of consumer distrust, with more than two-thirds of Canadians perceiving grocers as capitalizing on inflation to impose exorbitant pricing (15). Food constitutes a fundamental human necessity, with other essential requirements such as warmth and shelter being subject to direct regulation or significant government policy influence in Canada. Various components of the Canadian food distribution system fall under substantial regulatory oversight within the country. The Canadian Health Food Association delineates these regulations through three key legislative acts, namely the Food and Drugs Act, Safe Food for Canadians Act, and Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act (16). These acts ensure Canadians have transparent data (labeling, advertising, and claims) to make informed food decisions.\n\nWhile certain Canadian products, such as dairy and poultry, are subject to government regulation, including domestic production controls, wherein farmers are able to recover the costs of production (17), Canada does not currently have regulations dictating the prices that grocers charge to consumers (17). Although price ceilings may appear to address immediate concerns, implementing price ceilings on food items could potentially diminish consumers\u2019 access to fresh produce, hinder innovation, and limit investments in research (17). Perhaps greater competition and increased food innovation are necessary to address the issue of food inflation in Canada. This may be a key rationale behind the Competition Bureau Canada\u2019s decision to initiate a study into grocery prices. When addressing this inquiry, the Competition Bureau Canada noted, \u201cThere are differing perspectives on the causes of these price increases. Some contend that inflation has escalated the cost of goods for grocers, leading to higher prices. Conversely, others argue that grocers are setting higher prices due to a lack of sufficient competition in the market\u201d (18). The Competition Bureau of Canada has articulated the primary objective of its investigation as the pursuit of a deeper comprehension of pertinent issues. The aim is to identify strategies and measures that Canada can undertake to facilitate the competitive and innovative capacities of emerging enterprises (18).\n\nThe investigation into how Canada can assist competition (and thus, manage prices) and food innovation may result from a lack of action by the Competition Bureau Canada to date. In 1998, Loblaws acquired Provigo (19), in 2005, Metro acquired A&P (20), and in 2013, Sobeys acquired Safeway (21). In 2021, Loblaw, Metro, and Sobeys had over $100 billion in annual revenues (22) and were responsible for most food sales in Canada (13). Similar consolidations have faced scrutiny and may not be permitted elsewhere. In the United States, grocer consolidation faces opposition to reducing the likelihood of oligopolistic industries. Kroger (23) was trying to acquire Albertsons for approximately $25 billion and become the second-largest grocer in America (24). United States regulators have pushed back and may require the divestiture of a sizeable number of stores, effectively ensuring a competitive market is maintained, an action that both companies say they are willing to make to complete this proposed deal (25). In Canada, consumers are left to ponder whether grocery retailers are exploiting the unprecedented surge in inflation to impose prices that exceed a justifiable increase. Consumers harbor inquiries and apprehensions but find themselves unable to procure satisfactory responses.\n\nCurrent research indicates that, in the realm of policy matters, manufacturers tend to be perceived as more accountable than farmers and retailers (26). However, recent record-high inflation and the current rise in consumer distrust on popular and social media outlets have signaled that consumer concern may be shifting toward grocery retailers.\n\nThe primary objective of our study is to conduct an ethical analysis of the Canadian grocery industry, with a specific focus on examining the moral dimensions of grocers\u2019 conduct. This research seeks to delve into the growing public demand for greater accountability within the industry and, consequently, aims to put forth actionable recommendations to enhance transparency. Notably, the profitability of the grocery sector has hitherto received limited comprehensive scrutiny, making this investigation particularly significant. The unprecedented rise in food prices has raised ethical questions among Canadians, prompting inquiries into whether it is morally justifiable for grocery retailers to reap substantial financial gains while consumers face the challenges of limited alternatives for meeting their essential needs. This study aims to shed light on these critical ethical concerns.\n\nIn our study, we investigate the following research question: how have stakeholders perceived the economic consequences of rising food inflation? To examine the complex interplay between profitability and societal welfare, we adopt a paradoxical approach to corporate sustainability. Our investigation focuses on the Canadian economy as a case study to shed light on the escalating tensions between retailers and consumers. In this pursuit, we employ descriptive, instrumental, and normative dimensions of corporate sustainability (10) to observe and understand the moral landscape of the Canadian grocer oligopoly.\n\nWe aim to elucidate the factors responsible for the shift in consumer perception of Canadian grocers in 2022. Our analysis encompasses consumer data, corporate watchdog reports, and industry data, with the goal of proposing solutions to bolster trust and improve social and economic well-being within the Canadian grocery landscape. This research seeks to make the following significant contributions. Firstly, we intend to shed light on the evolving conditions that led Canadian consumers to lose trust in entire industries and accounting practices, which had previously not raised concerns. Secondly, we will explore the availability of information to consumers and the limitations therein.\n\nFinally, we will put forth a recommendation for a mandatory grocer code of conduct, encompassing enhanced financial reporting, and conclude by outlining avenues for future research.\n\nThe structure of our paper is as follows: In section 2, we will delve into the conceptual framework, which comprises three key antecedents essential to understanding the moral landscape of Canadian grocers\u2014namely, inflation, consumer trust, and the social aspect of sustainability. This will be followed by an explanation of our case study methodology and the specific factors we examined in section 3. Section 4 will present our findings, with the subsequent discussion taking place in section five. We will conclude by offering recommendations for formal agreements and increased transparency to aid grocers in regaining the trust of Canadians. It is our contention that through reestablishing this trust, grocers can not only enhance their positive social impact but also potentially, paradoxically, bolster their net profits, inflationary context, and consumer trust.\n\nTo address the tensions between grocers and consumers, we look to first understand the economic, behavioral, and financial antecedents to this conflict.\n\nInflation\n\nHart (27, p. 8) defines inflation as \u201ca process that raises price levels\u201d and \u201cdefining it like this, we can graft on adjectives to describe the intensity or mechanism of particular kinds of inflation.\u201d When discussing the consumer market, Glushchenko (28, p. 69) defines \u201cofficial inflation\u201d as \u201cthe growth of the overall level of consumer prices.\u201d He then listed the limitations of its measurement, including a consumer basket of goods often ignores items only purchased by the wealthy. That inflation based on a basket of consumer goods does not directly reflect a \u201creal\u201d reality. An example presented by Glushchenko was if one in 100 people purchase a television set, then one 100th of a television will be in the basket, and that number will be divided by 12 to represent monthly inflation. That \u201cbasket of goods\u201d is referred to as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and each country has its measurement of CPI.\n\nThe CPI basket of goods is not static, as evolving societal norms influence consumer preferences. Items that were once deemed luxurious, such as film cameras, may now constitute typical household expenditures (27). Moreover, inflation metrics have failed to account for the fact that consumer packaged goods have diminished in size, for instance, with some products offering fewer chips or a reduced weight compared to their previous iterations.\n\nTo communicate the direction and magnitude of rising inflation, adjectives such as \u201ccreeping,\u201d \u201cgalloping,\u201d and \u201chyper\u201d may be used (27). Hart likened the latter term, hyperinflation, to prices rising so fast that the purchasing power used to buy commodities would quickly evaporate off the paper money. When identifying inflationary terms and conditions that may harm society, Temple (29) found that while there is no evidence that moderate inflation can inhibit growth, high inflation, defined as over 100% per year, does inhibit growth. Regardless of the amount of inflation, Shaw (30) suggests it is society\u2019s democratic institutions, not the private sector, who should deal with \u201cnational agenda issues\u201d like inflation, pollution, and unemployment.\n\nWhile inflation can be mitigated through systemic policy decisions, the escalation in prices of specific products imposed by corporations on consumers can significantly influence consumer trust.\n\nConsumer trust\n\nBehavior often drives action. Sirdeshmukh et al. (31) adopted definition of consumer trust of Moorman et al. (32) as a \u201cwillingness to rely on an exchange partner in whom one has confidence.\u201d To understand the different types of exchange partners consumers may rely on in the food industry, we look to the literature. Wu et al. (33) find consumer trust in food and the systems that govern food distribution to be tied to both individual food items (i.e., through packaging labels, certifications, country of origin, and food traceability) and with producers, processors, and retailers providing consumers with food safety. The authors acknowledge that government agencies, third-party institutions, advocacy groups, and the media impact how consumers perceive labeling information and how food operators, including grocer retailers, are viewed by consumers.\n\nConsumer mistrust in the food system can impact consumer purchasing behavior. Nuttavuthisit and Th\u00f8gersen (34) found that consumers\u2019 mistrust in the food control system had a significant negative impact on purchasing organic food. Further, Macready et al. (26), in our study, we discovered that consumers\u2019 trust in participants within the food supply chain is contingent upon their perception of the participants\u2019 competence, level of care, and degree of openness. When consumers lack confidence in a participant, such as a grocery retailer, demonstrating care, and transparency in their actions, it results in a corresponding erosion of trust among consumers. Similarly, Rampl et al. (35) found integrity as a driver of consumer trust of food retailers.\n\nIt is crucial to examine the connections between consumer perception and consumer trust. Research has demonstrated that the emotional attachment between consumers and firms significantly impacts consumer loyalty and word-of-mouth communication (36). They found that place identity was a predictor of emotional attachment. Therefore, it is reasonable to investigate whether a negative place identity (e.g., associated with a grocery retailer) would diminish a consumer\u2019s emotional attachment and subsequently reduce their purchasing loyalty and positive word-of-mouth behavior.\n\nIn numerous countries, such as Canada, utilities undergo strict regulation, accompanied by regulations pertaining to housing affordability and housing choice. Conversely, the food retail sector, for the most part, remains unregulated. During periods of mounting financial stress and diminishing consumer trust, the potential consequences on society become more pronounced as families grapple with the challenge of providing sustenance for their loved ones amidst rising corporate profits, potentially resulting in an increasingly adverse social impact.\n\nSocial impact\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) means going beyond financial performance and shareholder interest (10). Given the link between managing systematic risk, portfolio value, and CSR (37), investors want reliable and transparent disclosures to aid in their investment choices.\n\nInternational investment stakeholders have called for transparent and reliable reporting that goes beyond financial accounting\u2014they want standards on environmental, social, and governance (ESG). As a result, in late 2021, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Board announced a new standards board, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) (38). The ISSB was created to deliver a global baseline for ESG disclosures to ensure international investment stakeholders have a complement of financial and sustainability measures to assist their decision-making process.\n\nSimilar appeals for greater openness among participants in the food chain to furnish pertinent information and enhance transparency are not novel. The need for heightened transparency may arise in response to product crises or deliberately engineered events. For instance, enhanced labeling transparency emerged as a response to Canada\u2019s mad cow disease (39) and the manufactured case of salmonella (40). However, what is relatively new is the extension for the call for transparency beyond personal crises toward overall transparency prior to a specific incident (26). It is at that system level that Bansal (41), as summarized by Hahn et al. (10), defined corporate sustainability as \u201cthe intersection of the three principles: environmental integrity, social equity, and economic prosperity.\u201d\n\nPrevious research has often framed sustainability as a \u201cbusiness case,\u201d focusing on the analysis and discussion of financial outcomes as the primary metric of success, with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations seen as a \u201ccost\u201d that could potentially have a negative impact on a company\u2019s financial performance (10). In contrast, the paradox perspective of sustainability encourages the consideration of the intrinsic value of multiple metrics beyond their direct and immediate impact on the company\u2019s bottom line (10). Hahn et al. (10) discovered that adopting a paradox perspective and evaluating sustainability in terms of descriptive, instrumental, and normative aspects led to superior contributions to business success.\n\nWhen examining the three dimensions of the paradox perspective on sustainability, the descriptive dimension serves the purpose of both \u201cdescribing and explaining\u201d sustainability issues, which aim to \u201ccapture organizational phenomena surrounding such tensions\u201d [(10), p. 240]. The instrumental dimension establishes connections between determinants and outcomes, encompassing both short- and long-term consequences. In contrast, the normative dimension encourages corporations to be accountable beyond mere financial returns and shareholder concerns, potentially contributing to a broader discourse on the role of business in sustainable development (10).\n\nWhen consumers are informed that rising grocery store costs are attributed to inflation, without accompanying empirical evidence to either substantiate or refute the claims made by grocers, it exacerbates tensions among consumers, corporate watchdogs, and the retail grocery industry. The prevailing dominant culture and historical lack of transparency in financial reporting are now being challenged more vigorously than ever before.\n\nThere is a social and moral impact of consumers facing increased costs to purchase food and provide their families with nutritious meals. The total annual cost of diet-related chronic disease in the United States exceeds 1 trillion dollars (42). Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that in the United States, there are nearly 1,000 deaths per day linked to cardiovascular and diabetes disease, with poor diet contributing factors (43). Food insecurity not only has immediate negative consequences but can also lead to long-lasting health and societal impacts.\n\nIn order to address the existing tension between Canadian grocers and consumers, our research endeavors to answer the following research questions: How do stakeholders perceive the economic impact of the rising food inflation?\n\nWe approach the examination of the conflict between corporate profits and societal welfare through the lens of the paradox perspective on corporate sustainability. To assess the escalating conflicts between grocers and consumers, as well as the role played by industry watchdogs, we employ the descriptive, instrumental, and normative dimensions of corporate sustainability.\n\nThis approach allows us to closely examine and comprehend the ethical landscape within which Canadian grocers operate. The tension between consumers and grocers encompasses economic, behavioral, and financial components, and mitigating this tension may yield positive social outcomes. Consequently, we proceed with our analysis of the ethical framework surrounding Canadian grocers.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nPragmatism philosophy guides our research methodology (44). We employ an abductive approach, whereby our case study strategy is operationalized by mixed-methods (44) over a longitudinal time horizon and focused on the grocery industry to investigate the evolving consumer perception and trustworthiness of Canadian grocers. Canada\u2019s food retail sector is primarily dominated by five major grocery retailers, three of which are Canadian public companies collectively generating an annual revenue exceeding 100 billion dollars. In our study, we will specifically examine the Canadian public company grocer retailers, namely Loblaw Companies Limited (referred to as Loblaw), Empire Company Limited (the exclusive owner of Sobeys Inc., referred to as Empire/Sobeys), and Metro Inc. (referred to as Metro), which are the three largest Canadian public grocers.\n\nWe utilized various techniques and procedures for our case study research strategy while collecting our data and performing analysis (45). When using a case study strategy, Yin (45), as cited by Eckhardt and Dobscha (46), recommends collecting data that includes annual reports, popular media and press releases, and observations of corporate leadership through published interviews. Additionally, we used Interim financial reports to examine current information.\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive review of communication from corporate watchdogs. Utilizing capital market data and custom algorithms, we evaluated the relative financial performance, including capital gains and total market returns, of various grocery retailers. Our analysis involved benchmarking their performance against the overall stock market for the period spanning from 2017 to 2022.\n\nStarting with the paradox perspective framework on corporate sustainability (10), we extended the model to include a historic perspective, such that our findings are organized using Canadian grocers\u2019 historical, descriptive, instrumental, and normative aspects. Our analysis focused on the social and financial outcomes of Canadian grocers.\n\nThrough data collected from consumers, corporate watchdogs, and retailers, we analyzed the moral landscape of Canadian grocers to understand how stakeholders experienced the impact of increased food inflation.\n\nFindings\n\nWe extend model of Hahn et al. (10) to include a historical aspect to analyze the paradox perspective framework of corporate sustainability, as outlined in our conceptual model in Figure 1. As such, our findings are organized according to the aspects in this model: historical, descriptive, instrumental, and normative.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1. Analyzing the moral landscape of Canadian grocers, a conceptual model.\n\nHistorical\n\nThe history of the Canadian grocery industry is marked by a story of consolidation. The prominent players in today\u2019s landscape were not always the expansive and dominant entities they are now, nor did they always possess the substantial market share they currently hold. The origins of Canada\u2019s modern grocery giants would appear quite unfamiliar to today\u2019s consumers. In this article, we provide a concise historical overview of the industry, organized as follows: we begin with an overview of key historical facts, followed by an examination of the market dynamics and regulatory pressures that led to the market entries and mergers. We conclude by drawing a comparative analysis with the grocery industries in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nHistorical facts\n\nWe can briefly summarize the history of Canada\u2019s major grocers to gain insight into their current market positions. Loblaw and Sobeys originated as limited-offering grocers around the conclusion of the First World War and underwent substantial expansion following the Second World War.\n\nLoblaw began with a cash and carry model for grocery in 1919, adding todays well known staples such as meat and produce in 1933 (47). Similarly, Sobeys began offering a full line of produce to customers in 1924 (48). In 1947, a handful of grocery buyers joined together as Lasalle Stores Ltd., (later becoming Metro in 1972) (49).\n\nLoblaw was incorporated in 1956, joining stores in Ontario and the United States into a single entity (50). In 1961, Giant Tiger is founded (51). Purchases then continue to fuel moderate expansion by the three major grocers, but major mergers, market entries, and acquisitions are rare between 1960 and 1980. In 1985, Costco joined the Canadian Market, opening its first store in British Columbia (52). Walmart subsequently entered Canada in 1994 with its purchase of Woolco Stores in Canada (53).\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the major grocers\u2019 operations are highly resemblant of their current day businesses. What remains are the major acquisitions of the 1990, 2000, and 2010s. 1998 was a significant year for the industry in Canada. It was then when Sobeys purchased Oshawa Group (which included most IGA stores), and when Loblaw purchased Provigo (19). With well-established market positions, the grocers intensified their diversification of product offerings in regard to food [for example, the (53) purchase of T&T, an Asian grocery chain (54)].\n\nVery recent merger and acquisition activity has only increased the degree of consolidation, with high profile acquisitions such as the purchase of Safeway by Sobeys Inc. (21), and Shoppers Drug Mart by Loblaw (in 2014) (55). Metro completed its own drugstore acquisition in 2018, buying Jean Coutu (56) while Sobeys completed its acquisitions of Farm Boy in 2018 (48), and Longos in 2021 (57).\n\nBy 2017, five companies (Loblaw, Sobeys, Metro, Walmart, and Giant Tiger) held over 70% of the Canadian grocery market (58). In the same year, there were approximately 7,000 independent grocery and convenience retailers remaining. By 2018, Costco and Walmart held market shares of 11 and 8%, respectively (59). At this point, the 7,000 independent grocery and convenience stores held approximately 20% of the market share (59).\n\nPressures leading to consolidation\n\nIn examining the factors that have contributed to the present state of the Canadian grocery industry, it may be beneficial to focus on the more recent history, starting in 1998. This marks a significant point in time, as it coincided with the entry of major American firms such as Costco and Walmart into the Canadian market. These market entries can be seen as a defining moment that separates the past from the current state of the Canadian grocery industry. Prior to 1998, market consolidation was primarily driven by the pursuit of greater scale, integration, and product diversity.\n\nMarket pressures\n\n\u201cThe entry of United States competitors appears to have had a significant impact on market pressures, with Canadian grocers now focusing on competition with United States entrants. This implies that American firms can leverage their larger scale to pass on price efficiencies to their customers, necessitating an increased scale for Canadian grocers to remain competitive. Regarding the Empire-Oshawa deal, George Fleishmann, then President of the Food and Consumer Product Manufacturers of Canada, was quoted as saying, \u201cThe consolidation is necessary as the Canadian industry prepares itself for competition from larger North American discount operations such as Costco and Walmart\u2019s new venture into the grocery business\u201d (60).\n\nOf the Provigo-Loblaw deal, the then commissioner of the Competition Bureau concluded \u201cthat increased competition is anticipated within the market from warehouse clubs, such as Costco, or mass merchandisers, such as Wal-Mart\u201d (61). Later mergers do, however, still rely on arguments about promoting price efficiencies through synergies and a need to increase diversity in product offering. For example, Loblaw had the following to say about the acquisition of Shoppers Drug Mart: \u201cIt strengthens both companies\u2019 competitiveness in an evolving retail landscape, creating new growth opportunities for shareholders. It will give consumers more choice, value and convenience\u201d (62).\n\nRegulatory pressures\n\nThe regulatory pressures involved in the industry\u2019s dealmaking can be best characterized by a seemingly paradoxical lack of pressure. As previously mentioned, when discussing the Provigo-Loblaw deal, the Commissioner of the Competition Bureau pointed out that increased competition was expected from retail giants like Costco and Walmart. In the case of the Loblaw-Provigo deal, the Competition Bureau mandated that Loblaw divest itself of 18 stores and nine pharmacy operations (63), despite gaining more than 1,200 drug stores across all provinces from the deal (20). In the Sobeys-Oshawa deal the Competition Bureau required Sobeys to divest of five stores and a distribution center, although the company had over 700 stores already at the time (64). The small-scale divestitures mandated by the Competition Bureau underscore the Bureau\u2019s regional approach to competition analysis. This approach seems aimed at preventing specific regions from being devoid of competitive grocery options within predetermined areas. Nevertheless, there appears to be a lack of substantial evidence regarding the analysis of these divestitures\u2019 potential impact on the overall grocery market in Canada.\n\nComparison to other countries\n\nWhen examining the history of Canadian grocery retail, it is pertinent to inquire whether Canada exhibits any unique characteristics when compared to its peer nations. The United States stands as a suitable point of comparison both in terms of geography and culture, while the United Kingdom provides a valuable perspective in terms of culture and politics. It is worth noting that the Overton Window in the United Kingdom may be positioned in a manner similar to that of Canada. Turning our attention to the United States, we observe a comparable level of market concentration among the top five grocery retailers. In 2017, these top five retailers collectively held a 66% market share, though it is important to highlight that certain regions exhibited even greater concentration. For instance, in the southern region of Texas, a striking 87% of the market share was controlled by just two companies (58).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there exists a notable level of market concentration among the major industry players, although this concentration is comparatively lower than that observed in Canada and the United States. According to a 2021, MarketLine report focusing on the Food and Grocery Retail industry in the United Kingdom, \u201cThe market is primarily controlled by prominent multinational corporations.\u201d The four most significant retailers in this sector\u2014Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, and Morrisons\u2014collectively command more than half of the market share (65). Although these countries exhibit a high degree of concentration among top players, Canada stands out as unique in that its degree of concentration is even higher.\n\nConsidering that Canada has reached a juncture where the three largest Canadian public grocery retailers exert significant control over the market, our analysis will concentrate on these three companies. We will present our findings pertaining to Canadian grocers by employing the three facets of the paradox perspective on corporate sustainability, namely the descriptive, instrumental, and normative aspects.\n\nDescriptive\n\nWe have looked into media, including coverage on operating segment results, as well as corporate press releases and published interviews that describe and explain the moral landscape of Canadian grocers.\n\nMedia\n\nCanadian grocers have garnered significant media attention in recent years due to issues such as bread price-fixing, labor union conflicts, the discontinuation of COVID-19 hero pay, and the emergence of record-high food prices and profits.\n\nThe Competition Bureau\u2019s ongoing investigation into alleged price-fixing aimed at artificially inflating bread prices was publicly disclosed in 2017. This disclosure subsequently led to a class-action lawsuit being filed on behalf of Canadian consumers (66). Loblaw Companies Ltd., along with several of its subsidiaries, and George Weston Ltd. were the sole entities offering compensation in the form of $25 gift cards to customers (66). Other entities mentioned in the lawsuit, such as Metro Inc. and Sobeys Inc., have denied any involvement (66).\n\nGrocery prices and corporate profits have soared over the last year, while grocery store workers continue to battle grocery giants in the quest for fair treatment. A recent example can be seen when more than 500 workers were laid off at a Loblaw distribution center in Calgary in 2022. Many workers are on strike for fair wages with Loblaw only offering a \u201cstraight money offer\u201d with no regulations around working conditions (67).\n\n\u201cHero pay\u201d was a term employed to describe the additional compensation provided to front-line workers, including grocery retail staff, whose efforts enabled Canadians to access essential goods and services during the COVID-19 lockdowns. This pay was introduced in March 2020 by several grocery chains and was discontinued in the first half of June of the same year, sparking controversy (68).\n\nIt is not unexpected that grocery retailers are currently under heightened scrutiny due to the growth in both gross and net margins in absolute dollar terms. This scrutiny comes at a time when many Canadian families are grappling with decisions concerning the preservation of discretionary income or even how to provide for their households. In contrast, the concept of shareholder primacy posits that the primary purpose of a corporation is to generate returns for its shareholders, with decision-making oriented toward a singular objective: maximizing shareholder value (69).\n\nIn the mainstream media, plenty of attention has been focused on high food prices, which are an important driver of CPI. They also hit lower-income households the hardest. Several industries engage in the sale and production of food: grocery stores, the manufacturers of food and soft drinks, alcohol, tobacco and cannabis, as well as the agriculture industry itself. Three of these four industries have had higher pre-tax profits in 2021 than before the pandemic (70).\n\nFood and beverage stores, such as grocery stores, were the biggest winners in this segment. They made $3.9 billion more pre-tax profit in 2021 than they did before the pandemic. Grocery stores faced higher input costs, as their cost of goods hit a record high in the third quarter of 2021. But these stores could pass that entire cost increase on to consumers while adding price markups. The industry hit record-high profit margins in the first quarter of 2021, squeezing more profit out of every dollar that it received in revenue compared to any other time in history (70).\n\nOn the other hand, the agriculture sector (i.e., Farmers) saw its profits cut in half in 2021 compared to pre-pandemic times, largely due to the drought in the summer of 2021. All other food industries that are higher up in the supply chain hit new all-time highs in profits and/or profit margins while farmers literally felt the heat (70).\n\nOperating segments\n\nRequired reporting for operating segments for public companies is laid out by International Financial Reporting Standard 8 Operating Segments. \u201cTwo or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment if aggregation is consistent with the core principle of this IFRS, the segments have similar economic characteristics, and the segments are similar.\u201d Annual reports for Canadian grocery retailers report all grocery results as one segment on the premise that the nature of the products and services are similar.\n\nThe Kroger Co.\u2019s Notice of 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders 2022 Proxy Statement and 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K states: \u201cThe Company\u2019s retail operations, which represent 97% of the Company\u2019s consolidated sales, are its only reportable segment\u201d (23).\n\nMetro indicates in their Q3 interim financial report, \u201cWe are pleased with the performance of our food and pharmacy businesses in the third quarter, which was achieved in a challenging operating environment with increasing inflationary pressures\u201d (71). \u201cThe thing is, Canada\u2019s major grocers, a group that also includes Metro Inc., have the ability to help lay the charges to rest. They decline to do so, however, using a loophole in accounting standards to obscure the facts about their operations. Their decisions to not publish greater detail on their businesses deprives the investing public of information that allows it to better evaluate the companies\u2019 shares, and the general public of information that might help address the policy question of whether grocers have indeed \u2018profited\u2019 from inflation\u201d (72). Loblaw and its peers are failing at that objective. For the sake of shareholders and Canadians, it is time to get more disclosure about the parts of grocers\u2019 businesses that are driving expanding profit margins (72).\n\nPress releases and published interviews\n\nReactions from the major players in the grocery industry can be characterized as indignant, citing a lack of understanding of the underpinnings of the business and compliance with requisite accounting regulations.\n\nAsked for additional comment, Loblaw spokesperson Catherine Thomas said: \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable with our continuous disclosure. It meets all accounting and legal requirements and provides our investors with an appropriate amount of color on our business.\u201d Metro declined to comment beyond its disclosures, while Empire did not respond to The Globe\u2019s queries (72).\n\nIn a letter shared with some of its customers on Monday, Loblaw chairperson and president Galen G. Weston says the price of an average basket of groceries is up about 10 per cent this year, with such items as apples, soup, and chips up even more. Weston said much of this is \u201cmaddeningly\u201d out of the company\u2019s control as food suppliers pass on higher costs to Loblaw (73).\n\nInstrumental\n\nThe instrumental aspect looks at short and long-term outcomes. Short term outcomes tend to be less than 1 year and are displayed as aggregated interim data for recent quarterly performance. Long-term outcomes of public market grocers may be measured with financial returns over a period of years.\n\nInterim data\n\nThe financial analysis of grocery quarterly earnings for the calendar year 2022 is shared with permission from Dalhousie University\u2019s Agri-food Analytics Lab (3).\n\nWe found the best and average gross profit for the most recent 5 years were 25.47 and 24.88% for Empire/Sobeys,19.99 and 19.82% for Metro, and 31.47 and 30.45% for Loblaw. We compared this historical performance against each company\u2019s most recent two quarters, and our findings are in Table 1 (3). Table 1 Table 1. Canadian grocer historical performance. All large grocers have an increase in gross profit in 2022 relative to their average past performance: Empire/Sobeys earned an excess of $56 million; Metro earned an excess of $7 million, and Loblaw earned an excess of $436 million. We observed Empire/Sobeys\u2019 performance in 2022 was overperforming relative to their best years in Q2 by $7 million, while their Q3 numbers had them underperforming by $44 million. For the most recent two quarters of 2022, Empire/Sobeys had a net deficit of $37 million relative to their best years\u2019 performance (3). When looking at performance of Metro (49) relative to its best years, we noted they were overperforming in Q1 by $3 million and underperforming by $14 million in Q2. For the most recent two quarters of 2022, Metro Inc. had a net deficit of $11 million relative to their best years\u2019 performance. In Q1 2022, Loblaw outperformed their best years\u2019 performance equivalent to $68 million; in Q2 2022, they outperformed their best years\u2019 performance by $112 million. In total, Loblaws\u2019 gross profit thus far in 2022 outperforms its best performance of the past 5 years by $180 million (3).\n\nCorporate returns\n\nCorporate returns reflect the market\u2019s assessment of the financial strength and viability of a corporation. We have included both the capital gains (i.e., growth in share price) and the total market returns (i.e., capital gains and dividends) to compare the results of each public company grocers\u2019 strategic results.\n\nCapital gains\n\nCapital gains returns reflect the market\u2019s assessment of the strength and viability of a corporation as perceived by current and potential investors. Figure 2 shows the market returns for Canadian grocers from 2016 to 2022.\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 2. Market returns for Canadian grocers 2016\u20132022.\n\nFor a period of 5 years (December 1, 2017, to November 30, 2022) a $1 investment in each of the Canadian public grocers grew to $2.24 (Loblaw), $1.95 (Metro), and $1.37 (Empire/Sobeys). Over the same period, $1 invested in the TSX/S&P Composite would have grown to $1.50.\n\nTotal market\n\nTotal market returns reflect the market\u2019s assessment of the strength and viability of a corporation as perceived by current and potential investors and the dividends declared and paid by the corporation. Figure 3 shows the total market returns for Canadian grocers 2016\u20132022.\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 3. Total market returns for Canadian grocers 2016\u20132022.\n\nFor a period of 5 years (December 1, 2017, to November 30, 2022) a $1 investment in each of the Canadian public grocers provided a total return of $2.52 (Loblaw), $2.18 (Metro), and $1.54 (Empire/Sobeys). Over the same period, $1 invested in the TSX/S&P Composite would have returned $1.85.\n\nNormative\n\nThe normative aspect allows for corporations to be a part of a greater discussion of the role of sustainable business practices. Given the lack of regulation of food prices in the Canadian mixed-market economy, it follows the lack of current normative practices of Canadian grocers.\n\nCompetition bureau investigation\n\nOn October 24, 2022, Canada\u2019s Competition Bureau announced they would be investigating the Canadian food supply chain. Below are the main questions addressed in that press release (74).\n\nThe study will examine three main questions: To what extent are higher grocery prices a result of changing competitive dynamics? What can we learn from steps that other countries have taken to increase competition in the sector? How can governments lower barriers to entry and expansion to stimulate competition for consumers?\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur findings suggest that record food inflation and a lack of transparency have eroded consumer trust in grocers. At a time of unprecedented inflation, a dearth of regulations, and increased consumer ability to voice concerns, a storm of \u201cGreedflation\u201d anxieties has emerged. A Canadian grocer has been found guilty of price-fixing for bread and may have engaged in tacit collusion to eliminate \u201chero pay.\u201d Some have even resorted to threatening union lockouts when workers requested improved working conditions. Simultaneously, grocers are enjoying favorable financial and market returns.\n\nGross profit is the difference between the prices grocers charge (revenues) and the cost of putting items on their shelves (cost of revenues). When discussing \u201cGreedflation,\u201d the concern is that grocers are capitalizing on high inflation to set prices unreasonably high. However, determining what constitutes \u201cexcessive\u201d profit is challenging. By examining a company\u2019s gross profit percentage (gross profit divided by sales multiplied by 100), we can establish a relative basis for year-over-year analysis. All three Canadian public grocers are outperforming the average in terms of gross profit, with the largest grocer, Loblaw, achieving its best gross profit performance yet (3).\n\nTo address their record-high performance, Loblaws earnings press release stated Q2 News Release attributes of Loblaw Reports 2022 Second Quarter Results (75) its increase in sales to an increase in same-store sales for food retail (0.9%) and drug retail (5.6%). This does not necessarily imply that the increase in gross profit can be attributed to the 0.9 and 5.6% respective increases in revenues from food and drug. However, the manner in which the information is presented may give such an impression. Similarly, when examining Metro\u2019s Q3 financial statements concerning their food and pharmacy businesses, it appears that the retailer also treats these as distinct segments. This raises questions about how grocery retailers interpret what qualifies as a reportable segment. If annual reports provided a more detailed breakdown of results, the public would have a better opportunity to gain a clearer understanding of the underlying dynamics.\n\nDue to current international reporting standards, Loblaws is not required to disclose the gross profit for each operating line (e.g., food, drugs, clothing, and beauty). Under international reporting standards, companies may aggregate operating segments with economically similar characteristics when segments are similar in all respects of the nature of, and customers for, their products and services, production, methods of distribution, and nature of the regulatory environment (76). IFRS does not provide a fulsome definition of the term \u201ceconomic characteristics.\u201d However, they do provide an example within the text of IFRS 8 in section 12 of the standard which reads:\n\nOperating segments often exhibit similar long-term financial performance if they have similar economic characteristics. For example, similar long-term average gross margins for two operating segments would be expected if their economic characteristics were similar.\n\nWhile this is a useful starting point for understanding what IFRS means when using the term \u201ceconomic characteristics,\u201d the picture becomes clearer when combined with the core principle of the standard. Section 1 reads:\n\nAn entity shall disclose information to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business activities in which it engages and the economic environments in which it operates.\n\nThese two sections, in combination, allow us to make a reasonable inference about the spirit of the standard. In our view, IFRS\u2019 intention is for reporting entities to disclose separate segments that have materially different gross margins because a financial statement user making an investment decision would care about those margins. A conjured example helps illustrate the point: If an investor were trying to decide whether or not to invest in Loblaw but found out that they have a margin of \u221210% on food, and + 30% on drugstore and clothing, they might believe it prudent to use their input as a shareholder to encourage the company to divest of its food business, and simply remain a drugstore and clothing store.\n\nUnder the current situation, it is impossible for users of financial statements to make this determination, which we would say is material to the investment decision making process. As recently as July 2022 Loblaw had told the public that their increased profits were due to their drugstore products, and not grocery products (77). This could be due to changes in volume of sales but also different gross margins being provided by these assorted products. Hence, we would say that they are not reporting within the spirit of the standard that is IFRS 8.\n\nCanadian public grocery retailers are subject to quarterly reviews and annual audits as a requirement of their public company status in Canada. Consequently, management assertions and judgments regarding operating segments have undergone evaluation by third-party auditors and have been found to be free of material misstatements. This implies that although it may not be immediately evident that the grocery industry shares similarities in terms of its nature, customer base, or production processes with other sectors such as pharmaceuticals, clothing, or beauty, both grocery store management and auditors have established a sufficient basis to conclude that they are, in fact, similar (to a reasonable extent).\n\nNevertheless, it is important to note that any changes in food-related regulations in Canada could potentially impact the interpretation of the last part of IFRS 8.12, specifically the section addressing the \u2018nature of the regulatory environment.\n\nFood is a fundamental human necessity, akin to housing, heating, and transportation. Unlike food prices, which are subject to market forces, housing, utilities, and specific segments of the transportation sector in Canada are influenced by regulatory measures aimed at ensuring equitable pricing for Canadians. In cases where there is a dearth of competition, such as in certain provincial utilities, these industries are subject to comprehensive government oversight. Nearly three-quarters of Canadians contend that they face challenges in satisfying their essential needs (78). Simultaneously, Canadian grocers continue to experience consistently robust economic performance, showing no signs of decline. This prompts consideration for enhanced government oversight regarding the pricing of food products for Canadian consumers.\n\nGovernment regulation of food retailers could play a pivotal role in ensuring Canadians can adequately provide for their families while fostering increased transparency in the reporting of results within Canadian grocery store operating segments. Should regulations be introduced for grocery financial reporting, it is plausible that grocer management and third-party auditors may face heightened challenges when attempting to consolidate sales and gross margins from distinct categories such as food, drugs, clothing, and beauty.\n\nRecent press releases from grocers have seen the release of select pieces of information, often used to justify their heightened gross profit margins, with claims that food sales have remained \u201crelatively flat,\u201d while gross profit margins on pharmaceutical drugs have witnessed an increase. Remarkably, the public response does not seem to express outrage toward grocers making increased profits on pharmaceuticals. This observation suggests that if grocers indeed experience heightened gross profits in other lines of business, increased transparency in reporting could serve to earn consumers\u2019 trust, consequently reducing the scrutiny placed on corporate profits. In other words, the perception of corporate profiteering in the food sector may be ameliorated through enhanced transparency in operating segments, which distinctly delineate gross profits from food and other product lines.\n\nOur research findings strongly indicate that record food inflation and the absence of transparency have adversely impacted consumer trust in grocers. However, the extent to which this has influenced consumer purchasing behavior remains unclear. Future research endeavors could delve into the intricate relationship between consumer trust and food inflation, shedding light on the potential consequences for consumer behavior in the grocery retail sector.\n\nConclusion\n\nForty-year record-high inflation and unprecedented food prices are currently impacting Canadians. Consequently, consumers are calling for increased government oversight. The implementation of a mandatory grocer code of conduct and enhanced transparency in financial reporting operating segments would empower stakeholders to assess the sources of grocer profits independently. Through these measures, grocers may begin to rebuild the trust that has been eroded among consumers. Paradoxically, when social needs are no longer perceived as neglected or exploited, corporate profits may indeed continue to rise, but this time with reduced scrutiny and social unrest.\n\nData availability statement\n\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, upon reasonable request.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nST: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

            "article_text": "(1) Tax and regulatory\n\nReal estate companies can identify \u201ccarrots\u201d (incentives and opportunities) and \u201csticks\u201d (regulations and challenges) toward achieving sustainability goals. Carrots include international, domestic, or state and local tax incentives; credits; and deductions. Firms that are able to redirect capital flows to more sustainable activities could secure more favorable financing terms. These carrots should align with the sticks: building performance standards. These sticks could prevent companies from selling or leasing properties that don\u2019t meet efficiency or emissions standards.\n\nOpportunities to integrate: Early into the integrated sustainability journey, firms can conduct frequent regulatory scanning to identify the highest priority carrots and sticks, or which tax credits and incentives could result in the greatest ROI. In Deloitte\u2019s 2024 Commercial Real Estate Outlook survey, only 32% of respondents said their firms were planning to leverage tax-savings options such as incentives and credits as a part of their sustainability strategies for 2024, which means the vast majority of respondent firms\u2014nearly 70%\u2014were not yet prioritizing opportunities to bolster their bottom lines.16\n\n(2) Risk and financial modeling\n\nIdentifying physical and transition risk should be a priority, not just for regulatory disclosure and compliance, but also as part of the property acquisition and underwriting processes. In the 2024 Outlook survey, respondents said real estate valuations that do not appropriately consider climate-related risk was the greatest material risk to investing in sustainable real assets.17\n\nPhysical risk includes those associated with climate-related acute or chronic events: Acute are point-in-time extreme weather cases like hurricanes or wildfires; chronic are progressive, longer-term events, such as sea level rises or extreme heat. Transition risk involves risks companies face when they fail to adequately respond to social and economic shifts toward achieving a low-carbon future. These can include new policy and regulatory changes, along with technology, market, reputational, and legal shifts. Some real estate companies may only be beginning to incorporate these risks into due diligence and forecasting.\n\nOpportunities to integrate: Conducting climate-risk assessments can help firms evaluate their level of understanding, management, and response to climate change and identify risks. Once leaders have achieved a higher level of understanding, they can develop their own climate risk strategy, prioritize improvements or upgrades, and consider how physical and transition risk can best be integrated into existing financial modeling. On a recent Deloitte webcast, Martin Howell, global energy skills leader at sustainable development company Arup, outlined how real estate firms can focus on both small-scale and large-scale improvements in the built environment:18\n\n\u201cThere are opportunities for improvement across all building stock. These range from very small, low-cost interventions, such as adjusting set points in control systems to reducing the temperature of hot water. Even backing off a little from maximum temperature can lead to carbon savings. There are plenty of opportunities for energy efficiency in building controls: occupancy sensors, daylight sensors, and there has been a lot of progress made in LED lighting. Greater opportunities are linked to bigger, end-of-life equipment\u2014for instance, older chillers that provide water for air-conditioning systems can be replaced with newer, more efficient, and dynamic models \u2026 Building owners are seeing an increase in the due diligence required for energy efficiency solutions. And that\u2019s being driven by commitments made by their organizations.\u201d\n\n(3) Accounting and reporting\n\nWith the recent Securities and Exchange Commission climate rule requiring registrants to provide climate disclosures in their annual reports beginning in 2025,19 the European Union\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and other recent international regulatory requirements, the ties between sustainability reporting and financial accounting are now more tangible than ever. Controllership should collaborate with sustainability function to help create and execute investor-grade sustainability accounting and reporting.20\n\nOpportunities to integrate: Some firms may still need to identify and take an inventory of requirements and consider how different frameworks and standards could intersect. They\u2019ll likely need to explore the data, processes, and internal controls they may have in place to support reporting. Firm leaders can also conduct regular materiality assessments, implement technologies that can assist with data sourcing and capture, and work with tenants to better collaborate on energy usage and emissions tracking.\n\nBut collaboration on sustainability initiatives between landlords and tenants is no simple feat; sustainability goals may not always be aligned. In a recent interview with the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, Tony Malkin, chair and CEO of Empire State Realty Trust, a New York City-based real estate investment trust, told Deloitte about how their company established a 10-step tenant energy optimization program, and made it publicly available for others to access, to help the industry shift that paradigm:21\n\n\u201cThe program outlines how to design, build, monitor, and verify lower energy consumption in tenant spaces. There is a lifestyle piece and a consumption piece. The lifestyle piece is through your own actions\u2014how you mitigate water consumption and waste disposal and have landfill diversion. The consumption piece is how we actually design spaces that perform at a higher level and provide the same service at the same quality at lower consumption. All these projects are then undertaken with tenant quality of life and productivity in mind. We also set up case studies for all of those invested in the life cycle of the space: engineers, architects, building managers, brokers, and tenants\u2014all of the pieces of the value chain\u2014to produce a lesser-impact occupancy.\u201d\n\nEmpire State Realty Trust also regularly engages with existing tenants to aid in their energy usage reduction targets and reporting needs. In 2023, they partnered with over 200 tenants to produce space-usage sustainability reports for their own company reporting and disclosure.\n\n(4) Strategy\n\nMore than 39% of carbon emissions come from the built environment.22 In the United States, the power grid is often complex and highly localized. How and where real estate companies choose to source that energy from can have an impact on individual asset and portfoliowide emissions, costs, and resiliency. In fact, when given several options for top sustainability initiatives for 2024, 40% of global real estate respondents to the 2024 Outlook survey said installing or procuring renewable energy sources such as wind or solar was their top priority.23 Real estate organizations like Toronto-headquartered Slate Asset Management24 and funds managed by CBRE Investment Management have made investments into renewable energy businesses including electric vehicle charging and solar power providers, respectively.25\n\nOpportunities to integrate: Firms should consider aligning geographically specific energy sourcing needs with tax incentives and credits that are most likely to have the greatest impact on ROI. These efforts should align with the organization\u2019s sustainability goals and targets. For many firms, operationalizing sustainability in these ways could require a delicate balance, especially for real estate investment trusts because the IRS has recently relaxed some of its restrictions.\n\n(5) Technology\n\nDeveloping a smart building often requires bringing multiple, often independent, buildingwide systems such as HVAC, lighting, or alarms together into a single information technology system that manages infrastructure. Smart building technologies can enhance tenant comfort while delivering cost savings by optimizing building energy efficiency and consumption. Some real estate leaders have taken notice: In our Outlook survey, investing in Internet of Things devices and smart technologies to track consumption was chosen as the top sustainability-related initiative by global real estate executives for 2024 (figure 3).26 Still, for some real estate leaders, the greatest challenge could be understanding the art of the possible and how to best integrate these systems within their enterprise."

            "article_text": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe state of New York reintroduced a pair of bills last week that call for climate risk and greenhouse gas emissions disclosures from large companies doing business in the state.\n\nThe Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act \u2014 or Senate Bill 3456 \u2014 would require entities whose revenue exceeded $1 billion in the prior fiscal year to disclose their carbon footprint if they do business or derive receipts from business activities in the Empire State. This revenue includes, but is not limited to, income received by subsidiaries of an entity that does business in New York. An earlier iteration of the bill was initially introduced in January 2023 .\n\nAnother bill focused on climate-related financial risk reporting \u2014 Senate Bill 3697 \u2014 requires disclosures from any entity formed under U.S. law and doing business in New York whose prior fiscal year total revenues exceed $500 million. An earlier iteration was introduced in October 2023 .\n\nDive Insight:\n\nNew York State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal introduced SB 3456 on Jan. 27, while Sen. James Sanders Jr. introduced SB 3697 on Jan. 29. Neither bill advanced beyond the senate committee they were presented to when first introduced in 2023.\n\nBoth climate bills were presented to the State Senate\u2019s Environmental Conservation Committee last week and are generally aligned with climate disclosure laws adopted by California in October 2023. The New York bills, however, offer varying reporting timelines.\n\nEntities with more than $1 billion in total revenues would be required to annually disclose their direct and indirect greenhouse emissions. Scope 1 and 2 emissions data would need to be disclosed starting 2027 for the prior fiscal year while scope 3 emissions data would need to be disclosed starting 2028 for the prior fiscal year, according to SB 3456 .\n\nThe bill does have certain exceptions for entities incorporated outside of New York. An out-of-state entity would not be considered as doing business in the state if it is only carrying out activities outlined in subsection (b) of section 1301 of the New York Business Corporation Law. These include an entity maintaining or defending an action or proceeding; holding meetings of its directors or shareholders; distributing information to these members; maintaining bank accounts and offices or agencies \u201conly for the transfer, exchange and registration of its securities, or appointing and maintaining trustees or depositaries with relation to its securities.\u201d\n\nTo comply with the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, entities would have to measure and report their emissions using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. However, the bill states that the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation could adopt a \u201cglobally recognized alternative accounting and reporting standard\u201d starting in 2034, if the state determined its use would more effectively support the objectives laid out in the act.\n\nSB 3697, on the other hand, focuses more on requiring entities with at least $500 million in total revenues to prepare reports on their climate-related financial risk. The reports would need to include disclosures aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework or another equivalent reporting requirement, according to the bill submitted Jan. 29. These reports would also need to detail measures adopted by the covered entity to reduce and adapt to its disclosed climate-related financial risk.\n\nThe second climate-risk disclosure bill also states that if a covered entity does not produce a report consistent with the required disclosures, it is expected to \u201cprovide the recommended disclosures to the best of its ability, provide a detailed explanation for any reporting gaps, and describe steps the covered entity will take to prepare complete disclosures.\u201d\n\nSB 3697 would also require entities to make their reports \u201cpublicly accessible\u201d and publish them on their respective websites. Entities would be expected to report biennially starting January 2028, according to the bill.\n\nLaw firm Ropes & Gray noted that the bills should be on companies\u2019 watch lists, but that it would be \u201cpremature to take compliance steps beyond that,\u201d given the bills are still in the beginning stage.\n\n\u201cThe predecessor bills of course were not adopted and it is unclear whether the current bills will gain traction, especially since they cover largely the same universe of companies as are required to report under California\u2019s climate disclosure laws,\u201d the law firm said in an analysis published Monday.\n\nRopes & Gray attorneys added that if the New York climate bills are adopted in their current form, they would \u201cnot require much of an incremental compliance lift by most companies\u201d due to their \u201csignificant overlap\u201d with California\u2019s climate bills. Some companies complying with California\u2019s climate-risk and greenhouse gas emissions disclosure laws will be expected to make disclosures as early as 2026.\n\nThe New York climate bills were introduced to the state senate about a week after President Donald Trump began his second term in the White House on Jan. 20.\n\nTrump kickstarted his first day with a bang and signed a flurry of executive orders that signaled an entirely different course of action from his predecessor on federal climate policy. Among these included orders to once again withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement; declare a national \u201cenergy emergency;\u201d pause all wind power development; and suspend all funding disbursements related to the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law."

            "article_text": "(Bloomberg) -- ESG fund managers have once again found themselves on the wrong side of a market meltdown.\n\nRoughly 770 ESG funds worldwide hold shares of Adani Green Energy Ltd., which just lost about a quarter of its value after US prosecutors charged Gautam Adani with suspected bribery. It\u2019s one of a group of companies in the Adani empire that made it past ESG screens, only to be dumped by investors as they digest a fresh litany of alleged breaches.\n\n\u201cAdani Green\u2019s terrible governance was in plain view,\u201d said Henry Kinnersley, co-founder of Snowcap Research, an activist investor that has previously warned of financial inconsistencies in the company\u2019s renewable energy claims.\n\nAlmost two years after a report by shortseller Hindenburg Research accused the Adani Group of decades of fraud and market manipulation, federal prosecutors in the US have alleged that Adani and a number of people around him promised more than $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials in exchange for solar energy contracts for Adani Green.\n\nThe Adani Group has denied the allegations. But news of the US indictment wiped about $27 billion off the Adani Group\u2019s combined market value as investors digest the details. And India\u2019s capital markets regulator is now said to be looking into whether the conglomerate violated rules mandating the disclosure of market-moving information.\n\nMost of the funds holding Adani Green are marketed as either \u201cpromoting\u201d environmental, social and good governance metrics, or making ESG an outright \u201cobjective,\u201d which are categories enshrined in European Union regulations.\n\nTogether, the 770 funds oversee about $400 billion and some of them are managed by the world\u2019s largest asset managers. On average, the holdings of Adani Green make up less than 1% of the funds\u2019 net asset value.\n\nESG fund managers are supposed to apply extra screens to protect investment clients from environmental, social and governance risks, something for which they often charge higher fees. But in practice, the label has repeatedly failed to deliver.\n\nBloomberg has previously reported that ESG funds were holders of Russian assets as Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. Those holdings extended to government bonds and state oil and gas companies. ESG funds were also wrong-footed by the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank early last year, after failing to react to mounting governance risks.\n\nThe fact that hundreds of ESG funds are still exposed to Adani Green is \u201csurprising,\u201d according to Mohit Mirpuri, a portfolio manager at SGMC Capital Pte. who says he sold his exposure to the company\u2019s bonds in late 2022, due to concerns the company was relying too much on leverage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no case to be made to hold shares right now,\u201d and the continued presence of ESG funds in the company \u201ccalls into question\u201d their ability to properly screen for governance risks, he said.\n\nInvestors who have long avoided ESG are using this as a moment to rip into the industry\u2019s apparent failings.\n\nBarry Norris, founder and chief investment officer of UK hedge fund Argonaut Capital Partners, said the Adani Green example shows that the ESG movement is perfectly capable of housing \u201cmalfeasance, chicanery and skulduggery,\u201d and doing so \u201cunder the cloak of morality.\u201d\n\nIndex providers also have faced some heat over their approach to due diligence when handing out the ESG ratings that determine how readily a company is included in exchange-traded funds and other passive strategies. There are about 70 ETFs tracking ESG benchmarks that hold Adani Green, Bloomberg data show.\n\nIn its complaint, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Adani Green used its \u201cA\u201d rating from the ESG research unit of MSCI Inc. to attract investors to a 2021 bond sale.\n\nClick here for an overview of Adani Green\u2019s ESG scores.\n\nMSCI downgraded Adani Green to \u201cBBB\u201d in July 2023, about six months after the Hindenburg report. The firm is now \u201cclosely reviewing\u201d the latest developments in the Adani case, a spokesperson told Bloomberg. MSCI flags business ethics and fraud allegations, including bribery, the spokesperson said.\n\nMorningstar Sustainalytics gives Adani Green a Risk Score of 14.3 on a scale of zero to 100, where 100 is the worst rating. It also assigns the company a so-called Risk Category of \u201clow.\u201d\n\nThe rating \u201cis primarily driven by the company\u2019s negligible risks related to material environmental and social issues, including human capital, occupational health and safety, land use and biodiversity, as well as product governance,\u201d Hortense Bioy, global head of sustainability research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed response to questions.\n\nBioy also noted that the company has been assigned a \u201cmedium\u201d Risk Score for its corporate governance, which accounts for 31% of the overall ESG issues deemed \u201cmaterial for the company,\u201d she said. And Adani Green has \u201cbeen flagged as having a significant level of controversy, with a weak business ethics program and a weak political involvement policy.\u201d\n\nThe company now faces \u201cincreasing financial, regulatory, and reputational risks stemming from new evidence and investigations into its allegedly fraudulent business practices,\u201d Bioy said, and Morningstar Sustainalytics\u2019 analysis \u201cwill be reviewed in light of recent events.\u201d\n\nAdani Green has been at the heart of India\u2019s shift to renewable energy, with the company\u2019s target of producing 50 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030 equivalent to roughly 10% of India\u2019s goals. And Gautam Adani, Asia\u2019s second-richest man, is a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a relationship that has benefited his sprawling business empire.\n\nMost investors expect weaker governance or legal structures when it comes to emerging markets, and India ranks 93 out of 180 countries in the Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International. But Adani Green has \u201cpositioned itself as a leader in environmentally conscious, socially responsible, and good corporate governance principles,\u201d the SEC said.\n\n\u201cThe dichotomy of ESG is that many investors chose to ignore\u201d the red flags surrounding Adani Green because it was operating in the sustainable sector, Snowcap\u2019s Kinnersley said.\n\nThe US indictment \u201cdispels the notion that governance can be assessed relative to local norms in a foreign market,\u201d he said. \u201cAny company raising capital from US investors should clearly expect to be held to US standards.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Amine Haddaoui.\n\n(Adds reference to previous Snowcap research in third paragraph, Indian probe in fifth.)\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P."

            "search_summary": "Kim Kardashian's $4bn SKIMS empire no better than TEMU, says bombshell new report\u00a0\u00a0Daily Mail",
            "article_text": "Kim Kardashian's SKIMS has become a high-end shapeware brand loved worldwide, but a damning report has revealed the company has a dark side.\n\nRemake, a global advocacy group, gave the $4 billion clothing giant a zero score in its 2024 accountability report which assesses brands' transparency, wages and wellbeing of employees, environmental impact and sustainability goals.\n\nThe zero placed SKIMS dead last, alongside fast fashion giant Temu that has been accused of forced labor and selling products deemed unsafe to human health.\n\nThe report blasted Kardashian's company for its carbon emissions, use of materials harmful to health and environment and unfair working conditions at a supply factory in South East Asia.\n\nKim Kardashian's shapewear and clothing company, SKIMS, received a score of zero in Remake's 2024 Fashion Accountability Report as the company eyes 2025 for an IPO\n\nEven before the assessment was released in March, Kardashian's company was under fire for unethical working conditions in a factory in Myanmar.\n\nBogart Lingerie (Yangon) Limited - a Myanmar-based garment supplier that SKIMS worked with until at least April 2022 - had been accused of inhumane work rates (including unpaid overtime), wage theft and gender-based harassment and violence.\n\nThe supplier has denied these allegations, and the SKIMS website claims that 'all of our warehouse and factory workers are ensured fair wages, safe environments and healthy working conditions.'\n\nIt's unclear whether Kardashian still works with this supplier or others in Myanmar because the company has never published a full list of its suppliers.\n\nIn fact, SKIMS provides zero transparency about their supply chain traceability, according to the Remake report.\n\nBut the company has previously stated that their products were sourced in Thailand, China and Turkey, and produced in Thailand and China.\n\nIn 2022, SKIMS was accused of greenwashing after the company falsely labelled its packaging as plastic-free, compostable and made from plants.\n\n'I AM NOT PLASTIC,' appears in bold letters on each packaged.\n\n'I am compostable made from plants. I will biodegrade in your home compost and in an industrial compost facility.'\n\nIn reality, the packaging is made from type-4 plastic, or low-density polyethylene (LDPE), which is recyclable but not biodegradable.\n\nSKIMS products are made primarily from conventional cotton, rayon and fossil-fuel-based materials, all of which have negative environmental impacts\n\nSKIMS is one of 15 companies assessed in Remake's report that have not committed to set any science-based emissions reduction targets.\n\nWithin this group, SKIMS is also one of 10 companies which have not disclosed any information on their carbon emissions, or set any goals to reduce emissions.\n\nThe report goes on to show that SKIMS garments are primarily made from materials that directly contribute to environmental pollution, deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nKardashian herself has been sued by members of her gardening and maintenance crew, who are not associated with the SKIMS brand but are her employees.\n\nThe employees claimed the star never paid on time, wouldn't allow for meal breaks and fired one on the spot for asking about overtime pay.\n\nRemake's assessment also revealed a stark lack of transparency around supply-chain traceability, wages and wellbeing of employees, environmental impact and sustainability goals.\n\n'They don't disclose anything,' Alexa Roccanova, senior advocacy manager at Remake and a co-author of the report, told Sourcing Journal.\n\n'They have a few statements saying that they produce with suppliers that share their ethical commitments, that kind of thing, but nothing that they say is backed by data. Not to mention that everything they produce is heavily reliant on fossil-fuel-based materials,' she said.\n\nSKIMS products are made primarily from conventional cotton and rayon (a synthetic fabric made from wood pulp), according to the report.\n\nConventional cotton farming is associated with extensive use of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals that contaminate rivers, lakes, wetlands, and underground aquifers. This practice also significantly degrades soil and drives erosion.\n\nRayon has been touted as an eco-friendly material because it comes from a renewable resource - trees. But harvesting wood contributes to deforestation, and producing the pulp requires large quantities of acid and toxic chemicals that pollute air and water.\n\nSKIMS manufacturing also relies heavily on oil-derived materials such as polyester and spandex, the production of which emits massive amounts of greenhouse gases.\n\nAccording to the most recent data available, polyester production for textiles produced roughly 1.5 trillion pounds of greenhouse gases in 2015 - the equivalent of 185 coal-fired power plants' annual emissions.\n\nThe only information that SKIMS has published on their commitment to sustainability can be found in a statement on their website.\n\n'At SKIMS, we are committed to the highest ethical standards and legal compliance in all aspects of our business and product supply chain. We only work with suppliers and vendors who we believe in and share our commitment to sustainability, accountability and transparency,' the statement reads.\n\nSKIMS did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment.\n\nRemake assessed 52 leading fashion brands for traceability, wages and wellbeing, commercial practices, raw materials, environmental justice and governance\n\nRemake's annual reports investigate key questions about the ethics of the world's leading fashion brands, including whether they set and achieve carbon emissions goals, pay their workers fairly and promote diversity within the company.\n\nAs it does with every company it evaluates, Remake asked SKIMS to disclose information about the company's operations prior to the assessment to ensure their evaluation would be as fair as possible.\n\nOut of 52 total companies assessed, SKIMS was among the 28 that declined to share this information.\n\nBecause of this, Remake was forced to rely on the company's publicly available information about their operations to calculate their score.\n\n'Scores are dependent on public disclosures and reflect the extent of a company's transparency,' the report states.\n\nRemake scored companies on a scale of zero to 150.\n\nA score of zero indicates the least possible level of transparency, goal-setting and progress towards those goals, whereas a score of 150 indicates the ideal level of transparency and action.\n\nThe highest scoring company was Everlane, an American clothing retailer, which earned a score of 40.\n\nThis is still far from the highest possible score. The report shows that Everlane and other companies at the top of the list have demonstrated that they are prioritizing ethical and sustainable operations.\n\nBut they 'still have a lot of room for improvement,' the report states.\n\nIn 2022, SKIMS was called out for greenwashing after the company falsely labelled its packaging as plastic-free, compostable and made from plants\n\nThis scrutiny doesn't appear to be holding SKIMS back from opening permanent stores across the US and internationally, and expand its line of menswear.\n\nBut there's a chance that the company's murky social and environmental standing could impact their ability to appeal to more ethically-minded shoppers, Roccanova told Sourcing Journal.\n\n'I'm not convinced that the SKIMS customer cares about climate change, but other customers prospective customers do. So I think if they want to remain leaders in this space, they're going to have to adapt,' she said."

These efforts, spearheaded by Mr. Antwi, are transforming Ghana\u2019s gold mining industry into a force for good.\n\n\u201cThis award is a reflection of our commitment to ethical business practices and our shared vision of a sustainable future,\u201d Mr. Antwi stated. \u201cOur untapped concessions represent opportunities not just for GERL, but for the entire country.\u201d\n\nAs the gold mining industry evolves, GERL stands at the forefront, ready to unlock its untapped potential and redefine mining in Ghana for generations to come.\n\nSource: Gold Empire Resources Limited"
