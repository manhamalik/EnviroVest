            "article_text": "Congressional Republicans\u2019 crusade to stymie the Biden administration\u2019s sustainable investing policies has kicked lobbyists and other advocates into high gear.\n\nEfforts to encourage or punish so-called environment, social and governance (ESG) investing has in recent years focused heavily on state governments, some of which have banned certain financial institutions from pushing companies to clean up their operations.\n\nBut with Republicans in the House majority and the administration getting more active in wanting to promote sustainable investing, lobbyists and other advocates are putting new energy into the fight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrganizations affiliated with conservative causes and industry are lining up to oppose ESG policies. While they support investors doing whatever they want with their money, ESG critics say the left simply wants to bully fund managers and institutions to quash fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a breach of fiduciary duty,\u201d Will Hild, executive director of the group Consumers\u2019 Research, told E&E News, referring to the obligation some asset managers have to maximize financial returns above all. \u201cIt\u2019s an improper use of public funds to push a political agenda.\u201d\n\nConsumers\u2019 Research, which has championed other conservative causes like fighting corporate diversity initiatives, has focused heavily on ESG in recent years. It counts Leonard Leo, the former executive vice president of the Federalist Society, as a prominent adviser.\n\nThe fight is about protecting industries that might not score well on ESG factors, Hild said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our No. 1 concern,\u201d he said. \u201cA nearly decadelong underinvestment in a number of industries \u2014 fossil fuels being the most notable, but you\u2019re seeing it in agriculture, you\u2019re seeing it in mining \u2014 is leading to a huge runup in the costs of commodities, which obviously go into the costs of everything.\u201d\n\nTheir influence is making a difference. Fighting ESG investing has become a Republican rallying cry. And bills on the issue are proliferating.\n\nEarlier this month, House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) announced a task force on ESG to be led by Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). The goal is to help craft consensus GOP policies (E&E Daily, Feb. 6).\n\nDems play defense\n\nHouse Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) are on opposing sides of the environmental, social and governance investing debate. Lobbyists are pushing both to help make their case on Capitol Hill. | Alex Brandon/Associated Press (McHenry); Francis Chung/POLITICO (Casten)\n\nESG supporters argue they are fighting to defend choice and protect the planet from climate change, and they say congressional Republicans and other ESG critics just want to support fossil fuels even is they pose an investor risk.\n\n\u201cCompanies are doing these things because they\u2019re responding to the communities they represent, the customers they want to sell to and their employees. They\u2019re doing this for business reasons,\u201d said Bryan McGannon, managing director of US SIF: The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment.\n\nThat organization represents the interests of fund managers, investors and investing data firms focused on sustainability.\n\nUS SIF has sought to elevate ESG on the federal level recently, including by supporting the establishment of the Congressional Sustainable Investment Caucus.\n\nReps. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) and Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) launched the caucus last month to \u201cplay defense\u201d on sustainable investing issues (E&E Daily, Jan. 26).\n\nLabor Department rule fight\n\nRep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) is sponsoring a resolution to scrap a Department of Labor environmental, social and governance investing tool. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn the short term, the lobbying from both sides of the issue is focused on legislation that would overturn a Department of Labor regulation allowing companies managing retirement funds some leeway to consider ESG factors in their investing decisions.\n\nThe resolution, led by Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.), uses the Congressional Review Act, which lets Congress overturn regulations in a streamlined manner. A vote is likely in early March.\n\nBecause of rules surrounding the CRA, Democrats can\u2019t stop it from getting a vote, and Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair Joe Manchin\u2019s (D-W.Va.) support gives the measure added momentum.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday railed against the effort, targeting his ire at the GOP.\n\n\u201cNothing in this DOL rule imposes any requirement on anyone. In fact, it goes out of the way to make sure decisionmaking remains solely in the hand of the fiduciary,\u201d Schumer said on the floor.\n\n\u201cRepublicans talk about small government. They like to talk about letting the private sector do its work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut their obsession with eliminating ESG, their sort of ostrich-like view about climate change and the damage that carbon presents when going into the atmosphere, would do just the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u2018Power of markets\u2019\n\nGroups like the National Association of Manufacturers argue that while their member companies are making advances on sustainability and similar priorities, regulatory actions like the DOL rule amount to unworkable mandates.\n\nCharles Crain, the group\u2019s senior director for economic policy, said the group supported a previous Trump administration rule that prohibited retirement funds from prioritizing ESG matters.\n\n\u201cIf pension plan managers are going to be making decisions on behalf of America\u2019s retirees, we felt that clarifying that those decisions should be made based on pecuniary factors was an important step,\u201d he said.\n\nNAM argues that the DOL rule is illegal because it goes beyond the agency\u2019s authority, and it\u2019s lobbying lawmakers to support it.\n\nMore than 100 groups signed onto a letter this month pushing lawmakers to back the resolution, calling the rule \u201cpolitically inappropriate\u201d and \u201cfinancially irresponsible.\u201d\n\nThe missive was led by Advancing American Freedom, a group launched by former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about ensuring that the free market is free, decisions aren\u2019t being made high up in a bureaucracy and that actual Americans are able to invest in the way that they want \u2014 Americans should be able to make these decisions,\u201d said John Shelton, the group\u2019s policy adviser.\n\nESG supporters, meanwhile, have been mobilizing in support of the rule and opposition to the legislation to repeal it, with a particular focus on shoring up support among Senate Democrats. The coalition includes mainstream environmental groups that until recently had not been heavily involved on finance issues in this way.\n\nPresident Joe Biden would surely veto legislation against his administration\u2019s ESG rule, but climate advocates don\u2019t want Congress on the record against it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real recognition of the power of markets in sustainable investing and also holding corporations accountable to the commitments that they make,\u201d said David Shadburn, a government affairs advocate at the League of Conservation Voters.\n\n\u201cThis ESG rule from the Department of Labor is about protecting retirement savings,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it should be a slam dunk for Democrats to go out there and say, \u2018We should not do anything that impacts the retirement savings of hardworking Americans.'\u201d\n\nFederal workers, SEC rule\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s headquarters in Washington. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo\n\nWhile the DOL rule may be the most immediate concern for ESG advocates, there are other matters on their agenda, too.\n\nESG opponents say major financial institutions are pushing environmental priorities even when investors don\u2019t seek out ESG, and they want the GOP to scrutinize them (E&E Daily, Feb. 6).\n\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, a body that sets policies for companies that do business with the government, is considering requiring federal contractors to disclose certain information about the sustainability of their operations, while some Republicans are pushing the \u201cNo ESG in TSP Act,\u201d which would prohibit the federal employees\u2019 401(k)-like retirement system from allowing anyone to invest in funds that consider ESG matters.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, has been considering requiring that publicly traded companies disclose details about their climate impact, including indirect emissions.\n\nSenate Agriculture ranking member John Boozman (R-Ark.), Braun and Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) introduced legislation in recent days \u2014 H.R. 1018 and S. 391 \u2014 meant to protect famers and ranches from the SEC rulemaking.\n\nDuring a panel a panel on Capitol Hill hosted by Americans for Financial Reform, Renaye Manley, deputy director of strategic initiatives at the Service Employees International Union, said pension funds and investors need that information to judge companies\u2019 long-term viability.\n\n\u201cAssessing climate risk is a key part of what it means to be a fiduciary in this moment,\u201d Manley said at the event.\n\n\u201cThe long-term nature and widespread impact that climate change will have on our lives and the lives of our children and our grandchildren means that \u2026 participants have to pay attention to the whole economy. And there may be no greater risk to the whole economy than the transition that we have to make to a low-carbon future.\u201d\n\nBut opponents say such a policy would exceed SEC\u2019s authority, which includes requiring disclosures about companies\u2019 performance and health.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that a disclosure obligation or a compliance requirement is in furtherance of those goals, that\u2019s within your statutory ambit. And to the extent that it isn\u2019t, it isn\u2019t,\u201d said NAM\u2019s Crain."
