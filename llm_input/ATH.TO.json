This information involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking information. No assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking information included in this News Release should not be unduly relied upon. This information speaks only as of the date of this News Release. In particular, this News Release contains forward-looking information pertaining to, but not limited to, the following: our strategic plans; the allocation of future capital; timing and quantum for shareholder returns including share buybacks; the terms of our NCIB program; our drilling plans; Leismer ramp-up to expected production rates; timing of Leismer\u2019s pre-payout royalty status; applicability of tax pools and the timing of tax payments; expected operating results at Hangingstone; Adjusted Funds Flow and Free Cash Flow in 2024 to 2026; type well economic metrics; number of drilling locations; forecasted daily production and the composition of production; our plans to release an ESG update; our outlook in respect of the Corporation\u2019s business environment, including in respect of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and new global heavy oil refining capacity; and other matters.\n\nIn addition, information and statements in this News Release relating to \"Reserves\" and \u201cResources\u201d are deemed to be forward-looking information, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves and resources described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated, and that the reserves and resources described can be profitably produced in the future. With respect to forward-looking information contained in this News Release, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: commodity prices; the regulatory framework governing royalties, taxes and environmental matters in the jurisdictions in which the Company conducts and will conduct business and the effects that such regulatory framework will have on the Company, including on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations; the Company\u2019s financial and operational flexibility; the Company\u2019s financial sustainability; Athabasca's cash flow break-even commodity price; the Company\u2019s ability to obtain qualified staff and equipment in a timely and cost-efficient manner; the applicability of technologies for the recovery and production of the Company\u2019s reserves and resources; future capital expenditures to be made by the Company; future sources of funding for the Company\u2019s capital programs; the Company\u2019s future debt levels; future production levels; the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing and/or enter into joint venture arrangements, on acceptable terms; operating costs; compliance of counterparties with the terms of contractual arrangements; impact of increasing competition globally; collection risk of outstanding accounts receivable from third parties; geological and engineering estimates in respect of the Company\u2019s reserves and resources; recoverability of reserves and resources; the geography of the areas in which the Company is conducting exploration and development activities and the quality of its assets. Certain other assumptions related to the Company\u2019s Reserves and Resources are contained in the report of McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. (\u201cMcDaniel\u201d) evaluating Athabasca\u2019s Proved Reserves, Probable Reserves and Contingent Resources as at December 31, 2023 (which is respectively referred to herein as the \"McDaniel Report\u201d).\n\nActual results could differ materially from those anticipated in this forward-looking information as a result of the risk factors set forth in the Company\u2019s Annual Information Form (\u201cAIF\u201d) dated February 29, 2024 available on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca, including, but not limited to: weakness in the oil and gas industry; exploration, development and production risks; prices, markets and marketing; market conditions; climate change and carbon pricing risk; statutes and regulations regarding the environment; regulatory environment and changes in applicable law; gathering and processing facilities, pipeline systems and rail; reputation and public perception of the oil and gas sector; environment, social and governance goals; political uncertainty; state of capital markets; ability to finance capital requirements; access to capital and insurance; abandonment and reclamation costs; changing demand for oil and natural gas products; anticipated benefits of acquisitions and dispositions; royalty regimes; foreign exchange rates and interest rates; reserves; hedging; operational dependence; operating costs; project risks; supply chain disruption; financial assurances; diluent supply; third party credit risk; indigenous claims; reliance on key personnel and operators; income tax; cybersecurity; advanced technologies; hydraulic fracturing; liability management; seasonality and weather conditions; unexpected events; internal controls; limitations and insurance; litigation; natural gas overlying bitumen resources; competition; chain of title and expiration of licenses and leases; breaches of confidentiality; new industry related activities or new geographical areas; water use restrictions and/or limited access to water; relationship with Duvernay Energy Corporation; management estimates and assumptions; third-party claims; conflicts of interest; inflation and cost management; credit ratings; growth management; impact of pandemics; ability of investors resident in the United States to enforce civil remedies in Canada; and risks related to our debt and securities. All subsequent forward-looking information, whether written or oral, attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.\n\nAlso included in this News Release are estimates of Athabasca's 2024 outlook which are based on the various assumptions as to production levels, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and other assumptions disclosed in this News Release. To the extent any such estimate constitutes a financial outlook, it was approved by management and the Board of Directors of Athabasca and is included to provide readers with an understanding of the Company\u2019s outlook. Management does not have firm commitments for all of the costs, expenditures, prices or other financial assumptions used to prepare the financial outlook or assurance that such operating results will be achieved and, accordingly, the complete financial effects of all of those costs, expenditures, prices and operating results are not objectively determinable. The actual results of operations of the Company and the resulting financial results may vary from the amounts set forth herein, and such variations may be material. The outlook and forward-looking information contained in this New Release was made as of the date of this News release and the Company disclaims any intention or obligations to update or revise such outlook and/or forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required pursuant to applicable law.\n\nOil and Gas Information\n\n\u201cBOEs\" may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.\n\nInitial Production Rates\n\nTest Results and Initial Production Rates: The well test results and initial production rates provided herein should be considered to be preliminary, except as otherwise indicated. Test results and initial production rates disclosed herein may not necessarily be indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery.\n\nReserves Information\n\nThe McDaniel Report was prepared using the assumptions and methodology guidelines outlined in the COGE Handbook and in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, effective December 31, 2023. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of bitumen, light crude oil and medium crude oil, tight oil, conventional natural gas, shale gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth above are estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary. The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. Reserves figures described herein have been rounded to the nearest MMbbl or MMboe. For additional information regarding the consolidated reserves and information concerning the resources of the Company as evaluated by McDaniel in the McDaniel Report, please refer to the Company\u2019s AIF.\n\nReserve Values (i.e. Net Asset Value) is calculated using the estimated net present value of all future net revenue from our reserves, before income taxes discounted at 10%, as estimated by McDaniel effective December 31, 2023 and based on average pricing of McDaniel, Sproule and GLJ as of January 1, 2024.\n\nThe 500 gross Duvernay drilling locations referenced include: 37 proved undeveloped locations and 76 probable undeveloped locations for a total of 113 booked locations with the balance being unbooked locations. Proved undeveloped locations and probable undeveloped locations are booked and derived from the Company's most recent independent reserves evaluation as prepared by McDaniel as of December 31, 2023 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Unbooked locations are internal management estimates. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources (including contingent or prospective). Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of Athabasca\u2019s multi-year drilling activities expected to occur over the next two decades based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the availability of funding, commodity prices, provincial fiscal and royalty policies, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors.\n\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures, and Production Disclosure\n\nThe \"Corporate Consolidated Adjusted Funds Flow\", \u201cCorporate Consolidated Adjusted Funds Flow per Share\u201d, \"Athabasca (Thermal Oil) Adjusted Funds Flow\", \"Duvernay Energy Adjusted Funds Flow\", \u201cCorporate Consolidated Free Cash Flow\u201d, \"Athabasca (Thermal Oil) Free Cash Flow\", \"Duvernay Energy Free Cash Flow\", \"Duvernay Energy Operating Income\", \"Duvernay Energy Operating Netback\", \"Athabasca (Thermal Oil) Operating Income\", \"Athabasca (Thermal Oil) Operating Netback\", \u201cCorporate Consolidated Operating Income\", \"Corporate Consolidated Operating Netback\", \" Corporate Consolidated Operating Income Net of Realized Hedging\", \" Corporate Consolidated Operating Netback Net of Realized Hedging\", \u201cCash Transportation & Marketing Expense\u201d, \"Cash Financing and Interest Expense\", \"Cash Stock-Based Compensation Expense\" and \"Realized Foreign Exchange\" financial measures contained in this News Release do not have standardized meanings which are prescribed by IFRS and they are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures or ratios.

            "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: A dump truck works at an oil sands extraction facility near Fort McMurray, Alta. in 2014.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press\n\nThe body developing Canada\u2019s version of new international climate and sustainability disclosure rules will issue its first reporting standards in December, and it will be up to regulators and governments to decide if and when those standards will be compulsory.\n\nThe Canadian Sustainability Standards Board on Monday released a report from a public campaign it held earlier this year to get input into proposed guidelines. The standards are scheduled to be ready for adoption at the beginning of 2025 on a voluntary basis, said Bruce Marchand, interim chair of the CSSB.\n\nThe board is now in the process of finalizing its guidelines, factoring in the submissions it received. Mr. Marchand said the response rate was very high for a standard-setting exercise in accounting.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing because we need that kind of feedback to determine what to do with these standards. And in particular, under our criteria for modification, we\u2019re looking at only those modifications that are in the Canadian public interest,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe depend on the Canadian respondents to spell out what those issues are, and their arguments and concerns, and they have done so in spades.\u201d\n\nInvestors have been calling for the rules to be applied in financial markets, so they can judge companies\u2019 non-financial risks tied to climate change and other environmental and social issues in line with a growing number of jurisdictions around the world.\n\nThe CSSB said it is in talks with governments and regulators, including Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), who will make their own decisions about what to make mandatory.\n\nTwo weeks ago, federal Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland announced her government is proceeding with mandating climate-related financial disclosures for large, federally incorporated companies. The move will require amending the Canada Business Corporations Act. Mr. Marchand said the CSSB is hopeful that Ottawa will use its soon-to-be-released standards as the basis for its rules.\n\nInvestors support proposed Canadian sustainability disclosures, but companies are pushing back\n\nMeantime, CSA, the umbrella group for provincial and territorial securities commissions, has said it will examine the CSSB\u2019s work before deciding on moving to mandatory reporting.\n\nThe draft standards are based on those developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board. The CSSB was formed to tailor the new rules to an economy heavy in resource extraction, and in small and medium-sized companies.\n\nThe standards prescribe reporting key sustainability and climate metrics, including carbon emissions, risks tied to environmental issues, analysis of potential policy scenarios and other items. The international stands call for disclosures in conjunction with financial filings.\n\nIn its report, the CSSB said it considered responses from 529 individuals and 392 organizations. Investors, policy makers, regulators, sustainability professionals and Indigenous people are among those who participated via roundtable discussions, surveys and response letters.\n\nIn July, The Globe and Mail reported that publicly available submissions showed a stark divide on the proposals between institutional investors and public companies, notably those in energy, utilities and mining. The report bears that out.\n\nThe former group is pushing for quick adoption of sustainability and climate reporting standards that are closely aligned with the international ones, while the latter want much of the disclosure to remain voluntary and exclude some items, including Scope 3 emissions. Those are emissions that stem from entities in a company\u2019s supply chain and from end use of its products.\n\nIt said many large investors oppose lengthy relief periods for adopting the standards, and support inclusion of Scope 3 emissions as is the case in the international rules, even if initial reporting is incomplete.\n\nOpposition came mostly from preparers of disclosures, and warned of increased reporting burdens and costs, especially on small businesses, as they must also compile required financial data.\n\nMr. Marchand said Ottawa\u2019s recent passing of anti-greenwashing provisions within the Competition Act, which put companies at risk of financial penalties for making false or exaggerated environmental claims, added \u201cnew context\u201d as the board went about its work. Related to that, some companies voiced support for \u201csafe-harbour\u201d provisions within the CSSB standards to guard against legal threats, he said.\n\nPreparers also cautioned that Canada could suffer a loss of competitiveness if its requirements are more stringent than those in the United States. They noted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission excluded the indirect emissions from reporting requirements enacted earlier this year."

            "article_text": "Following the COP28 United Nations Climate Change Conference, the world has largely agreed to transition away from fossil fuels. As the home of the fourth largest proven crude oil reserve in the world,1 Canadian oil producers have a key role to play in global decarbonization and will undoubtedly face challenges as the world moves further down the transition pathway. These companies could be uniquely positioned to decarbonize and avoid stranded assets by not only diversifying their business streams, but also by capitalizing on hydrocarbon uses beyond combustion.\n\nUnconventional Oil in a Unique Environment\n\nAlberta\u2019s oil sands make up 94% of Canada\u2019s oil reserves2 and approximately 10% of the world\u2019s proven reserves.3 Northern Alberta offers expansive unconventional hydrocarbon resources of low-grade crude oil called bitumen. Bitumen is thick and viscous with a tar-like consistency, making it much more difficult to recover than traditional hydrocarbons elsewhere in the world. Because bitumen oil takes a lot of energy to mine and separate from the sand, oil sands extraction typically releases more greenhouse gases (GHGs) than other forms of oil production. Between 1990 and 2021, Canada\u2019s GHG emissions from conventional oil production increased by 24%, while emissions from oil sands production increased by 463%, mainly driven by a rapid increase in production (see Figure 1).4 And in 2024, as oil sands producers plan to continue increasing production in anticipation of the completion of the Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) pipeline,5 a recent study published in January warns that emissions from Canada\u2019s oil sands are being vastly underreported.6\n\nFigure 1. Oil and Gas Sector Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Canada, 1990 to 2021\n\nSource: Environment and Climate Change Canada, www.canada.ca/environmental-indicators. For informational purposes only.\n\nApart from the unique attributes of its hydrocarbon resources, the oil sands present additional material environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, such as community relations and biodiversity loss, that have the potential to impact the oil and gas producers operating there. The oil sands are located in Canada\u2019s boreal forest, which is a unique ecosystem stretching 5,000 km across the country from coast to coast. In addition, many of the surface mining deposits in the oil sands flank the Athabasca River, an important waterway providing support for multiple Indigenous communities across Alberta and crucial habitats for endangered wildlife. Effectively preventing and managing environmental spills and releases from the oil sands operations is critical to preserving surrounding ecosystems and securing and maintaining a social license to operate.\n\nBanking on Carbon Capture and Storage for Scope 1 and 2 Decarbonization\n\nAccording to analysis conducted by the Global Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Institute,7 the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is one of the largest and most suitable basins for CCS globally. With this advantage, oil sands producers appear to be banking on CCS as the main method to decarbonize Alberta\u2019s resource-rich economy.\n\nAlberta\u2019s six largest oil and gas producers formed Pathways Alliance, which aims to work with the Federal and Alberta governments to achieve net zero GHG emissions from oil sands operations by 2050. The alliance\u2019s three-phase plan includes reducing current oil sands GHG emissions by approximately 22 megatonnes of CO2 emissions (scope 1 and 2) per year by 2030 and planned investments of CAD 24.5 billion (USD 18.1 billion) on CCS and other major emissions reduction projects and technologies.8\n\nA CCS hub and transportation network proposed by Pathways Alliance would transport and store GHG emissions from over 20 smaller CCS facilities across the oil sands, with aims to sequester more than 10 megatonnes of carbon per year. With support from the Government of Alberta, the project is moving ahead with pore space (i.e., underground storage rights) being awarded to Pathways Alliance, and drilling tests and engineering work underway.\n\nHowever, Pathways Alliance\u2019s activity and the long-term success of the proposed CO2 hub is heavily contingent on fiscal frameworks \u2014 at both the provincial and federal levels \u2014 as well as results of a formal consultation with 25 Indigenous communities located around the proposed pore space and CO2 transportation line.\n\nAdditional Challenges to Lowering Oil Sands Emissions\n\nOil sands producers are relying heavily on CCS to meet their decarbonization targets. Adding to their net zero challenges is the fact that Alberta\u2019s energy grid is mainly powered by natural gas.9 As the Alberta Utilities Commission instituted a moratorium on approving wind and solar power projects greater than one megawatt in August of 202310 and has since banned renewable power projects on prime agricultural land,11 producers now have limited short-term opportunities to replace fossil fuel power generation with renewable solutions, and therefore lower their scope 2 emissions sources.\n\nA November 2023 report from the International Energy Agency warns against banking on CCS as the planet continues to warm. The report states oil and gas companies need to consider diversifying into clean energy rather than simply counting on carbon capture to help them maintain the status quo.12\n\nWith so much riding on the success of CCS in the oil sands, it\u2019s important to consider if producers have additional risk mitigation strategies in place to successfully navigate through the low-carbon transition \u2013 especially in relation to their scope 3 emissions, which essentially remain unmanaged.\n\nFigure 2 below demonstrates the strength of GHG risk management programs for Canadian oil and gas producers as compared to their global peers. Canada is lagging behind U.S. and European producers, but is more closely aligned to global management levels.\n\nFigure 2. Evaluation of Oil and Gas Producers' Greenhouse Gas Risk Management Programs\n\nSource: Morningstar Sustainalytics. For informational purposes only.\n\nNote: The data for this analysis was retrieved on December 21, 2023, from Sustainalytics Risk Rating Universe. Analysis of oil and gas sector companies includes 40 Canadian companies, 57 U.S. companies, 72 EU companies, and 244 global companies.\n\nAlternative Opportunities to Align With the Low Carbon Transition\n\nIn the longer term, there may be other opportunities for oil sands producers to lower their emissions. For instance, Phase 2 (2031 \u2013 2040) of Pathways Alliance\u2019s net zero plan includes investment in more research and development for alternative power sources. This includes potentially using hydrogen, more electrification, and small modular reactors.13 And already in early 2024, an agreement has been reached between an Alberta power producer and one of North America\u2019s most diverse electricity generators to jointly assess the development and deployment of grid-scale small modular reactors to advance nuclear power generation in Alberta and create net zero power solutions.14\n\nAnother step oil and gas producers are taking in response to climate-related transition risks is diversifying their product portfolios to include sustainable or lower-carbon fuels and alternative streams of business. We are seeing this already with producers investing in technologies such as renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and hydrogen production.\n\nIn fact, Alberta is now Canada\u2019s hydrogen leader with plans for a world-class hub in Edmonton.15 The province also offers opportunities in the global critical minerals race, with the opening of Alberta\u2019s first lithium extraction pilot project. Alberta is home to one of the world\u2019s largest lithium deposits and until recently there has been little interest in developing this deposit.16 However, lithium is now a key focus of the Canadian government\u2019s CAD 3.8 billion (USD 2.8 billion) eight-year critical minerals strategy, which aims to increase domestic extraction and production.17 A Calgary-based junior resource company has developed a technology to extract naturally occurring lithium from oil field brines, and local producers are partnering with, and investing in, such companies to provide technical and development support.18\n\nFigure 3 shows that some Canadian oil and gas producers are ahead of U.S. producers when it comes to introducing sustainable products and services and generating revenues from them. However, both Canadian and U.S. companies are not diversifying their product portfolios with the same rigor as their European or global peers.\n\nFigure 3. Oil and Gas Producers' Revenues From Sustainable Products and Services\n\nSource: Morningstar Sustainalytics.\n\nNote: The data for this analysis was retrieved on December 21, 2023, from Sustainalytics Risk Rating Universe. Analysis of oil and gas sector companies includes 40 Canadian companies, 57 U.S. companies, 73 EU companies, and 244 global companies.\n\nThe Next Frontier: Bitumen Beyond Combustion\n\nDespite its dirty reputation, Canada\u2019s unconventional bitumen oil also presents some diversification opportunities for oil sands producers. Where light crude oil is primarily made into fuel, heavy bitumen oil has many potential uses beyond burning it.\n\nAlberta Innovates19 has developed a strategy called Bitumen Beyond Combustion (BBC), believing that the Alberta oil sands could contribute to achieving net zero emissions goals if this resource was used to create valued products and not just combustible fuels. The BBC strategy calls for a greater portion of bitumen production to be diverted away from fuel production and dedicated to the manufacture of high-value materials, such as asphalt binders or carbon fibre. In doing so, the carbon from the bitumen would remain trapped within the products and not released into the atmosphere.20\n\nAnalysis by Alberta Innovates shows that BBC can create more economic value and reduce GHG emissions, with potential total annual revenue exceeding CAD 100 billion (USD 73.9 billion) per year by 2050.21 A recent study has also shown that oil sands production would have to drop by as much as 90% for Alberta to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 in the absence of a BBC strategy. However, if BBC was implemented, bitumen production could be maintained or even increased in net zero by 2050 scenarios.22\n\nNevertheless, significant investment and policy support would be required to turn the bitumen beyond combustion vision into reality.\n\nDrawing the Line\n\nParticipating nations in COP28 have come to a final agreement that calls for the orderly transition away from fossil fuels. As investors consider their options within the oil and gas sector, it\u2019s important to understand the unique risks and opportunities specific to where and how producers operate. Although the pathway to decarbonize the Canadian oil sands via what could be one of the world\u2019s leading CCS hubs seems promising, producers could be in for a bumpy ride on their net zero journey if they don't consider alternative and innovative opportunities to diversify away from fossil fuel combustion.\n\nReferences"

Future communication is said to be dependent on additional guidance and clarity from the Competition Bureau.\n\nThe sudden absence of information has sparked diverse interpretations among the public. Some believe this is a precautionary measure as companies navigate the new legislation, while others view it as a tacit admission that previous disclosures may have been misleading. Consequently, many companies prefer to limit their disclosures rather than risk potential liability. Saying nothing should not be the default position going forward, as corporate disclosures hold significant value.\n\nThere is a viable path to achieve transparency while ensuring compliance.

Ms. Smith says the cap would represent an unconstitutional intrusion into provincial matters, and has vowed to fight it in court.\n\nOther actions proposed by Ms. Smith include seizing ownership of data that Alberta oil and gas companies collect about greenhouse gases at facilities, barring entry to energy facilities by federal officials, and ensuring no provincial entity helps Ottawa implement or enforce the cap.\n\nFederal Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson is standing by his decision to implement an emissions cap despite Alberta\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t actually believe in the science of climate change and say somehow every other sector of the economy actually has to do things to change, but the oil and gas sector does not,\u201d Mr. Wilkinson said in an interview Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous. And anybody who says that doesn\u2019t believe in climate change or just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAll facilities that emit 10,000 tonnes per year or more of greenhouse gases must already report their annual emissions to the federal government under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which was established in March, 2004.\n\nMs. Smith said companies would be banned from handing over emissions information to anyone but the Alberta government via a condition on their operational licence.\n\n\u201cCompanies should look at this and thank us for this, for being willing to protect them from federal government overreach,\u201d Ms. Smith said Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re anticipating that this should be welcomed by the energy sector.\u201d\n\nMr. Wilkinson said Wednesday he doesn\u2019t understand the point of the province collecting information first.\n\n\u201cEither you\u2019re going to pass that data on, or you\u2019re going to somehow manipulate that data \u2013 which would not be something that I think most people would think an elected premier would think about doing,\u201d he said.\n\nAnna Johnston, a lawyer with West Coast Environmental Law, said the list of proposed actions has little legal precedent and could place companies in legal jeopardy.\n\n\u201cIf Danielle Smith were to put a fraction of the energy that she uses for this political mud slinging into actually getting Alberta to drop its emissions, then we might not need this emissions cap at all,\u201d she said.\n\nJanetta McKenzie, the interim director of oil and gas at the Pembina Institute, an environmental think tank, said such action would be possible were the province to simply follow its own Emissions Reduction and Energy Development Plan, which it released in 2023.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to square this plan to reduce emissions \u2013 and commitments from industry to invest in decarbonization projects \u2013 with this pushback to emissions regulation on the idea that there\u2019s no way to meet it and comply with the cap without shutting in production,\u201d she said.\n\nAlberta takes its fight with Ottawa to another level over the federal emissions cap\n\nOttawa\u2019s planned cap would limit greenhouse gas emissions from Canada\u2019s oil and gas sector to 35 per cent below 2019 levels. Ms. Smith says it\u2019s impossible for the sector to meet the target without a production cut, but the federal government maintains that firm targets are necessary to spur action on emissions reduction.\n\nThe Pathways Alliance, a coalition of Canada\u2019s largest oil sands companies, has pledged to bring emissions from production to net-zero by 2050. President Kendall Dilling said in a statement Wednesday that the proposed federal cap is \u201cunnecessary, unworkable and will undermine existing climate policy.\u201d\n\nHowever, neither Mr. Dilling nor the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers has directly addressed the implications of the Alberta government\u2019s latest plan to fight the cap.\n\nConor Chell, national leader of environmental, social and governance (ESG) legal risk and disclosure at KPMG, said the move to restrict emissions information underscores the tension between the federal and provincial governments over oil and gas development and limiting greenhouse gases.\n\n\u201cThe province is arguing that what they\u2019re proposing here would fall within the scope of its natural resources, whereas the federal government obviously is taking the position that regulation of emissions data is more related to the environment, which is an area of dual jurisdiction,\u201d he said.\n\nThe province taking control of emissions disclosure could put publicly listed companies in the middle of that fight.\n\nThe Canadian Securities Administrators, the umbrella group of provincial securities commissions, has said it will examine new standards being developed for disclosing carbon emissions, with the expectation that reporting will be made mandatory in some form. The Canadian Sustainability Standards Board is expected to release its guidelines shortly, and the CSA has said it will examine those when it formulates its rules.\n\nMeanwhile, Ottawa said last month that it will require climate-related financial disclosures for large, federally incorporated private companies. Corporations are also under pressure from their major institutional investors to share emissions data, so it can be compared with peer companies in Canada and internationally."

            "article_text": "Global energy demand will grow significantly in the period to 2050, driven by population increases as well as the desire of those in the developing world to improve their standards of living. Hydrocarbons will continue to play a very significant role in meeting this growth in energy demand, and unconventional sources of oil and gas (including the oil sands) will become increasingly important. Innovative technological development will be necessary to address the challenges of increasing supply and social and environmental issues. The latter are local/regional (e.g., water use and land impacts) and national/international (e.g., greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions).\n\nCanada is uniquely advantaged in having abundant unconventional hydrocarbon resources. Canada\u2019s oil sands deposits are mainly located in northern Alberta, and at present 170 billion barrels are considered economical to develop. Another 145 billion barrels are not at this time considered economically feasible to develop. The oil sands are recovered by surface mining and in situ techniques; the latter process is similar to conventional production techniques.\n\nThe energy sector is a major economic driver for Canada. The oil sands alone currently contribute 112,000 jobs across Canada, and over the next 25 years it is expected to contribute over 11 million person years of employment to Canada and $1.7 trillion to the Canadian economy \u2014 spread all across the country. As well as contributing greatly to the economy of Canada, the oil sands provide a secure and reliable source of energy, for Canada and for North America.\n\nThere is an environmental impact associated with oil sands development, and this paper explores GHG emissions, air pollutants, tailings ponds, biodiversity, water use and quality, and surface land disturbance, all as they relate to the oil sands.\n\nIt is important to put the environmental aspects of oil sands production in context \u2014 GHG emissions for the oil sands are 5 percent of Canada\u2019s total emissions, compared with 22 percent coming from transportation. As Canada\u2019s total GHG emissions are 2 percent of global emissions, oil sands GHG emissions represent 1/1,000th of global GHG emissions. While this emissions level will grow as production increases, it is important to note that emissions, on an per barrel basis, have declined in the past 20 years. And technology will, as it progresses, continue to reduce GHG emissions per barrel, and significantly reduce absolute emissions as compared with the business-as-usual case.\n\nOther environmental issues are also being addressed. Tailings ponds are strictly controlled by regulation in Alberta. New technology is being deployed to accelerate movement to dry tailings. Water use has been and will continue to be reduced in the extraction process. Regulations and monitoring are in place to assess the health of rivers and lakes in the oil sands region.\n\nLand disturbance, especially in mining areas, is not pretty, but producers are by law required to reclaim any land disturbed by development. The areas disturbed are currently relatively small, with only 602 km2 having been affected to date by mining activity, and with 67 km2 under active reclamation. Air quality in the oil sands region is constantly rated better than major Canadian cities such as Vancouver and Montreal.\n\nThere is no question that the environmental performance of the development of the oil sands must continue to improve. This will be done largely through transformative technological change. Significant progress has been made to date, but in many areas \u2014 including GHG emissions reduction, water use, tailings ponds, and in-situ-upgrading-technology development \u2014 much remains to be done. Industry and governments are focused on environmental monitoring and performance improvement.\n\nThe oil sands impact on the environment has become one of the main drivers of scientific research and technological development in Canada. It is important for Canada and the oil sands industry to accelerate the takeup of technological innovation and implement environmental performance improvements.\n\nThe oil sands positively and negatively affect the social fabric of nearby communities. These communities benefit greatly from the economic activity associated with oil sands development. However, they are also most directly impacted by social, housing, infrastructure and other pressures arising from increased activity in the region. Efforts are being made to make up the infrastructure and labour deficits in this part of northern Alberta. Concerns about health conditions for local residents have prompted numerous studies, and the monitoring of the health of those living downstream from oil sands should continue.\n\nAny discussion of the oil sands needs to begin with a broader overview of global energy supply and demand (figure 1). An International Energy Agency (IEA) 2009 report concludes the following:\n\nGlobal energy demand will grow significantly in the period to 2050, driven by population growth and the need for energy to improve standards of living in much of the developing world. For example, there are 1 billion cars on the world\u2019s roads today, and that number will double by 2050.\n\nWhile renewables will become an increasingly important part of the future energy supply mix in Canada and globally, hydrocarbons will provide the majority of the world\u2019s energy supply for many years to come.\n\nWith the decline of conventional hydrocarbon supplies, unconventional sources of oil and gas (including oil sands) will become more important.\n\nMassive capital investment is required to enable the necessary growth in energy supply.\n\nEnvironmental and social challenges associated with energy development of all kinds will become more significant.\n\nThere will be an increasingly important role for technology, both in enabling economic development of supply and in addressing environmental and social challenges.\n\nOn a global scale, reducing GHG emissions is the most significant environmental challenge that must be addressed going forward.\n\nThe energy sector is a major economic driver for Canada. The oil sands alone currently contributes 112,000 jobs across Canada, and over the next 25 years it is expected to contribute over 11 million person years of employment to Canada and $1.7 trillion to the Canadian economy \u2014 spread all across the country.\n\nThe IEA\u2019s 2009 report presents the results of two scenarios \u2014 the \u201cReference Scenario,\u201d which provides a baseline picture of how global energy markets would evolve if governments made no changes at all to their existing energy and environment policies; and the \u201c450 Scenario,\u201d which depicts a world in which collective policy action is taken to limit the long-term concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere to 450 parts per million of CO2.\n\nHere are the main points of the Reference Scenario, assuming no significant energy and environmental policy changes:\n\nWorld primary energy demand is projected to increase by 1.5 percent per year between 2007 and 2030 \u2014 an overall increase of 40 percent.\n\nFossil fuels remain the dominant source of primary energy \u2014 oil is the single largest fuel in the mix. \u00e2\u2014\u008f World electricity demand is projected to grow at an annual rate of 2.5 percent to 2030 \u2014 with the largest increases in China \u2014 and coal is the major fuel in this sector.\n\nThere is a rise in use of modern, nonhydro, renewable energy technologies \u2014 wind, solar, geothermal, tide and wave, and bio-energy.\n\nThere is a projected decline in energy investment that would have serious consequences for energy security, climate change and energy poverty; the question therefore is: Will the investment needed to meet growing world energy demands be mobilized? The cumulative investment is estimated to be $26 trillion.\n\nThe result of the Reference Scenario is a rapid and dramatic increase in GHG emissions.\n\nSecurity of energy supply is a major issue resulting from the Reference Scenario.\n\nThe electricity needs of the world\u2019s poor are not met.\n\nThe 450 Scenario assumes policy action to promote a low-carbon future.\n\nIt is argued that the most effective route to reach this goal is through energy efficiency in buildings, industry and transport, especially new vehicle technologies; decarbonization of the power sector, where coal-based electricity generation is reduced by half; and nuclear and renewable energy.\n\nIn order to reach this goal, there must be a massive financial investment of $10.5 trillion more than in the Reference Scenario. However, this investment should result in financial saving to the developed and developing world through economic, health and energy security benefits.\n\nThere will be a dramatic increase in demand for natural gas (17 percent between 2007 and 2030), with the most rapid increase in China, India and the Middle East, but the cost of developing these resources will increase as well.\n\nThe key energy markets of the future will be China and India, plus the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; global energy activity will be refocused toward Asia. Given the continuing economic issues faced by the developed world and the results of the COP15 meeting in Copenhagen, it is very doubtful that the 450 Scenario will be realized. Similarly, even though the Copenhagen Accord is perhaps less than some anticipated from the COP15, it is unrealistic to believe that developed and developing countries will take no action to reduce GHGs, will not increase renewable energy sources, and will not develop policies to promote and enhance energy efficiency.\n\nSince the time of the writing of the current paper, which formed the basis of the oil sands dialogues, the IEA has published its World Energy Outlook 2010. This is an important report, as it helps put the oil sands dialogues in a global energy context. The IEA indicates that energy demand will increase globally by 36 percent between 2008 and 2035. Developing countries will account for 93 percent of that projected increase, with China contributing 36 percent to it. Fossil fuels, oil, coal and natural gas will remain the dominant energy sources to 2035. Regardless of what measures are taken globally to address climate change, oil will remain the dominant fuel. Specifically, IEA mentions the contribution of the oil sands to this scenario. It states,\n\nUnconventional oil is set to play an increasingly important role in world oil supply through to 2035, regardless of what government do to curb demand\u2026output rises from 2.3 [million b/d] in 2009 to 9.5 [million b/d] in 2035. Canadian oilsands and Venezuela extra-heavy oil dominate the mix. The report recognizes that renewable energy use will triple during the period, raising its contribution from 7 percent to 14 percent by 2035.\n\nThese two scenarios and their inherent differences, plus the 2010 IEA report, highlight the conundrum facing policy-makers, the industry and the public with respect to decisions about the nature of our future energy system.\n\nThe Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, which underlies most of Alberta and parts of Saskatchewan, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories, is the primary source of Canadian crude oil.\n\nCanada\u2019s oil sands deposits are divided into three major regions in northern Alberta, referred to as the Athabasca, Cold Lake and Peace River deposits (figure 2). The Alberta Energy Resources and Conservation Board (ERCB) estimated at year-end 2009 that these areas contain established reserves of 170 billion barrels that are economical to develop, given current technology.\n\nOn the basis of geological evidence, there is additional oil that is recoverable using current technology, but not economic in current conditions, and could raise Canada\u2019s bitumen resources up to 315 billion barrels.\n\nOf the remaining 170 billion barrels in established reserves in Alberta, 135 billion barrels, or 80 percent, are considered recoverable by in situ methods, and 35 billion barrels (20 percent) by surface mining. In situ recovery is similar to conventional production techniques. It includes primary production, whereby the bitumen can be recovered without addition of heat, and other recovery methods, whereby steam, water or other solvents are injected into the reservoir to reduce the viscosity of the bitumen, allowing it to flow to the surface to a vertical or horizontal well.\n\nThere are also smaller deposits in northwest Saskatchewan, next to the Athabasca oil sands deposit. The Saskatchewan Ministry of Energy and Resources has estimated that 2.7 million hectares of land has oil sands potential, but the resource base has not officially been determined.\n\nRecovery of raw bitumen using in situ methods is set to surpass production using mining methods in the middle of this decade. In light of the integrated nature of the developments and their scale, most mining production is upgraded in Alberta. Currently, of the in situ projects in operation, only the Long Lake Project, operated by Nexen Inc., has integrated upgrading facilities. Also, production from the Suncor Firebag and MacKay River projects is upgraded at Suncor\u2019s facilities. Otherwise, the majority of in situ bitumen production is not upgraded prior to reaching markets in the US.\n\nIn 2009, Canadian oil production was 2.7 million barrels per day (b/d), with 2.5 million from western Canada. The growth case put forward by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) shows production expected to reach 4.3 million b/d by 2025 (figure 3).\n\nThe crude oil forecast released by CAPP in June 2010 is designed to provide an objective view of the changes in crude oil supply over the next 15 years. This forecast is similar to that of the previous year. In the first quarter of 2010, world oil prices increased to US$70-85 per-barrel range, a range that meets the required threshold for the economic viability of many oil sands projects. As a result, projects that were \u201cput on the shelf\u201d during the economic downturn are being returned to active planning and development.\n\nThis improved outlook for the industry coincides with new investments in oil sands projects by major Chinese companies. This will contribute to renewed activity and future production growth. CAPP\u2019s estimate for industry capital spending on oil sands development is $13 billion for 2010.\n\nOil sands production currently makes up 55 percent of western Canada\u2019s total crude oil production. Under the growth case, production is expected to grow from over 1.3 million b/d in 2009 to approximately 2.2 million b/d in 2015 and to about 3.5 million b/d in 2025.\n\nThe development and operating costs of the oil sands continue to be toward the high end of the range of costs for oil projects on a global basis. Although growth in global demand is expected to continue to provide impetus for oil sands development, this is a competiveness issue for Canadian producers and reinforces the importance of technology development to lower unit costs.\n\nEnergy supply and development in its many different forms underpin the economic aspirations of every region of Canada.\n\nThe energy sector represents the largest single private investor of capital in Canada and continues to attract the single largest slice of foreign direct investment, and these investments are spread across the country.\n\nThe energy sector is a major economic driver for Canada, accounting for 6.8 percent of Canada\u2019s GDP in 2008 and directly employing 276,000 persons, or about 1.9 percent of total direct employment in Canada. In 2007, oil exports alone generated nearly $70 billion for the Canadian economy.\n\nThe Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) estimates that the oil sands industry alone will add 3 percent to Canada\u2019s GDP by 2020 and will create, during the period to 2020, 5.4 million person years of employment, 44 percent of which will be outside Alberta (table 1).\n\nCurrently the oil sands industry contributes toward 112,000 jobs across Canada and, according to CERI, over the next 25 years it is expected to contribute over 11 million person years of employment to Canada and $1.7 trillion to the Canadian economy (figures 4-6).\n\nWhile Alberta accounts for the largest portion (90 percent), the impact across Canada will be significant. It is estimated that the Alberta oil sands industry will purchase roughly $170 billion in supplies and services from other Canadian provinces over the next 25 years. This includes $54.9 billion from Ontario, $45.5 billion from British Columbia and $23.2 billion from Quebec.\n\nLooking at the economics of the oil sands from another point of view, it is helpful to see where they fit into the production curve when compared with other energy sources. Tables 2 and 3, developed by the IEA in 2009, illustrate that the oil sands are somewhere in the middle of the cost curve for development of energy sources.\n\nThere is, and should be, a considerable amount of focus on the oil sands in terms of their economic contribution and their role in providing secure and reliable energy supply. It would be an understatement to say that, along with the economic discussion, a great deal of attention is being paid to the oil sands environmental impact. Emission of pollutants and GHGs, tailings ponds, biodiversity, water quality and use, land disturbance and the boreal forest \u2014 virtually everything about oil sands development has an environmental dimension. These issues range from the local and regional to the international. In particular, the oil sands have become an icon for those who oppose development and the use of fossil fuels.\n\nDue to its very large oil sands resource, stability and adherence to democratic principles, Canada is at the forefront of the dialogue and debate about hydrocarbon resources and climate change. This also places Canada, Alberta and the oil and gas industry at the forefront of efforts to concurrently advance economic benefits, energy security and responsible environmental performance. The oil sands are at the epicentre of this dialogue.\n\nIt should be noted that oil sands development, like other resource developments, takes place within a substantive regulatory regime, with shared responsibilities between the federal and provincial orders of government.\n\nCERI, in its May 2008 report \u201cGreen Bitumen: The Role of Nuclear, Gasification and CCS in Alberta\u2019s Oilsands,\u201d states that in 2007 the oilsands industry accounted for 5 percent of Canada\u2019s total GHG emissions, compared to 24 percent coming from the transportation sector. Canada\u2019s emissions are 0.5 percent of those of the US and 1/1,000th of global GHG emissions. According to Environment Canada, since 1990 emissions have been reduced by 39 percent per barrel. By 2015, according to CERI, the oil sands could account for 8 percent of Canada\u2019s GHG emissions, assuming current technology continues unchanged.\n\nThis is very unlikely to materialize, given the research and development of new technology in this area.\n\nWhile it is important to put the oil sands GHG emissions in context, and there has been significant improvement in their per barrel discharges over the past 20 years, oil sands GHG emissions are expected to rise in absolute terms for the foreseeable future. The increase in production drives an increase in GHG emissions in absolute terms, although the per barrel discharge is declining significantly and emissions are considerably lower than the business-as-usual case.\n\nThe energy sector is a major economic driver for Canada, accounting for 6.8 percent of Canada\u2019s GDP in 2008 and directly employing 276,000 persons, or about 1.9 percent of total direct employment in Canada. In 2007, oil exports alone generated nearly $70 billion for the Canadian economy.\n\nIn 2002, Alberta began taking steps to establish the first compliance carbon offset system in North America. The 2002 Alberta Climate Change Emissions Management Act (CCEMA) required large emitters to record and file statements of annual GHG emissions beginning in 2003. In 2007, Alberta became the first jurisdiction in North America to legislate GHG emissions reductions for large industrial facilities. Any facility, including oil sands, that emits more than 100,000 tonnes of GHGs per year is required to reduce its emissions per barrel by 12 percent below 2003-05 levels starting in 2007. Facilities that fail to meet this target have the option of buying Alberta=based carbon offsets, or paying the Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund C$15 for each tonne that exceeds reduction targets. The Fund supports projects and technologies aimed at reducing GHG emissions in the province. Measures implemented by Alberta are targeted to reduce GHG emissions by 50 percent by 2050, as compared to existing operational practices. The first group of projects has been selected, and CCEMC is currently soliciting proposals to increase energy efficiency.\n\nThe Alberta Energy Research Institute (AERI) in 2009 conducted a study and released two reports on the life cycle analysis of North American and imported crude oils. These \u201cwell to wheel\u201d impact reports compared Alberta oil sands with other oil producing regions to provide a baseline for emerging and new technologies and their potential to reduce GHG emissions. Oil sands pathways generally have 10 percent higher emissions than conventional crudes. The report also concluded that when oil sands production pathways are given credit for electricity cogeneration, the emissions from the oil sands can be comparable to emissions from conventional crudes entering the United States market.\n\nAERI concludes its analysis by stating that technological advances will further decrease GHG emissions for oil sands crudes. It is important to note that, in addition to the application of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in some projects, there is great potential to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of oil sands operations through improvements in the efficiency of subsurface recovery processes and in ongoing energy efficiency improvements in producing operations.\n\nThe Alberta Ingenuity Centre for In Situ Energy (AICISE) involves the development and deployment of in situ processes. It has five major themes: catalysis, integrated recovery processes, advanced simulation, bitumen characterization and reservoir characterization, all with the intent to change the nature of in situ mining to radically reduce GHG emissions.\n\nAs well, the Alberta Ingenuity Centre for Oil Sands Innovation is a partnership between Imperial Oil and the University of Alberta that focuses on mining for the oil sands. It is researching nonaqueous extraction of oil sands, which would avoid water consumption, and new upgrading technology, which would integrate extraction and upgrading.\n\nIn addition to the individual researchers working in the areas of engineering, biology, chemistry and geology, business and law, the University of Calgary and the University of Alberta are engaged in a number of initiatives and organizations related to the oil sands (figure 7).\n\nThe Wabamun Area Sequestration Project (WASP) is the largest-scale geological study in Canadian history for the permanent underground storage of millions of tonnes of industrial GHGs. The WASP study assessed the geological and technical requirements, economic feasibility and technical and regulatory issues related to the potential to safely store up to 1,000 megatonnes of CO2. The University of Calgary partnered with AERI; the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; and industry partners TransAlta, TransCanada Corporation, ARC Energy Trust and Penn West Energy Trust.\n\nThe air quality in Fort McMurray, the closest urban area to the Athabasca oil sands, was rated \u201cgood\u201d 98 percent of the time during 2008. Air quality in the oil sands region is consistently rated better than in major Canadian cities such as Vancouver and Montreal.\n\nIt is important to note that, in addition to Alberta-based scientists and researchers, there are many others across Canada and internationally engaged in addressing the challenges associated with oil sands development and operations.\n\nTailings ponds associated with oil sands mining present a significant reclamation challenge.\n\nTailings are a result of any mining process, and for oil sands they are a mixture of fine clay, sands, water and residual bitumen produced through the oil sands extraction process. As tailings settle, a portion will eventually form mature fine tailings, a substance that has historically taken many decades to firm up sufficiently for reclamation. Existing tailings ponds cover approximately 130 km2 of land. The first tailings pond to be reclaimed will be Suncor\u2019s Pond 1, in 2010.\n\nRecent technological developments, an example of which is the tailings technology now being applied by Suncor, could result in the transformative changes needed to ensure land reclamation at an accelerated rate. The Suncor process results in dry tailings ponds, allowing more rapid reclamation to occur.\n\nIn addition, Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) has developed and instituted a process whereby CO2 is injected into tailings to accelerate fines separation. It allows for faster water recycling with less water use and some capture of C02. Syncrude has introduced centrifuging tailings to accelerate fines separation, also resulting in less water use and reducing the ponds.\n\nThe aim of all this is to reduce the water use in tailings ponds. This would go beyond the 2009 Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board directive designed to reduce the amount of liquid tailings \u2014 thereby speeding reclamation.\n\nThe Oil Sands Tailing Research Facility (OSTRF) is a University of Alberta incubator for faculty and students to work with the oil sands industry. Research projects at OSTRF \u2014 many of which are designed and managed by graduate students \u2014 investigate ways to handle oil sands tailings, with the goal of being able to reclaim the oil sands landscape directly following mining.\n\nA major focus of oil sands research is reducing water use through recycling, with a goal of zero liquid discharge. Just a few years ago, 10 barrels of water were required to produce 1 barrel of oil. Now it is 2 to 3 barrels of water per barrel of oil for mining and half a barrel of water for every barrel of oil for in situ techniques. Today, 5 percent of water used in Alberta is by the oil sands.\n\nStrict limits are placed on industry\u2019s water use through the Water Management Framework for the Lower Athabasca River. This framework is one of the most protective policies to apply to year-round water withdrawals in a northern climate anywhere in the world. Strict water monitoring is also maintained through the Regional Aquatics Monitoring Program (RAMP), a community-based environmental monitoring program that specifically assesses the health of rivers and lakes in the oil sands region of northeastern Alberta. All this is to ensure that oil sands development does not negatively affect human health.\n\nThe federal government, recognizing the concern about seepage issues as they relate to tailings ponds, and water quality issues related to oil sands development more generally, has introduced a scientific program that includes state-of-the-art analytical equipment to perform chemical fingerprinting of any contaminants in the Athabasca River. This would allow identification of any chemicals produced in oil sands operations that are found in the surrounding environment.\n\nWhile oil sands operations currently impact only a very small portion of Canada\u2019s expansive boreal forest, concerns have been expressed regarding the adequacy of protected areas and the potential impact of oil sands development on certain species at risk, such as caribou populations.\n\nCanada\u2019s oil sands are found below the surface of 142,200 km2 of land, an area smaller than the state of Illinois. The oil sands are located in the Canadian boreal forest, which is as large as 88 percent of the entire United States land area (figure 8).\n\nThe oil sands underlie 4.4 percent of Canada\u2019s total boreal forest. Of this total oil sands area, only 3.4 percent is mineable, or 0.15 percent of Canada\u2019s boreal forest area. This leaves almost all of the boreal forest untouched by oil sands activities. It also means that, to the greatest extent possible, wildlife, especially the caribou, remain protected.\n\nClose to 97 percent of the oil sands area will be developed using in situ technologies. In situ projects resemble conventional oil development (i.e., wells/drilling) and do not require tailings ponds or mine pits. Land use impacts differ between mining and in situ recovery operations. In total about 4,802 km2 of oil sands are suitable for surface mining. To date, 602 km2 of land has been affected by mining activity, and 65 km2 is under active reclamation.\n\nIn more than 40 years, oil sands mining has disturbed about two hundredths of 1 percent of the Canadian boreal forest; a total land area about the size of the city proper of Chicago, or 2 percent of the greater Chicago metropolitan area. Oil sands producers are required by law to reclaim any land disturbed by oil sands development. Companies must have reclamation plans in place and approved prior to receiving approval to disturb any land. The government of Alberta requires financial guarantees to ensure that all reclamation is completed.\n\nFor the oil sands mining region, the area under active reclamation is 67 km2, and in March 2008, the first oil sands mining reclamation certificate was issued by the government of Alberta. Companies apply for reclamation certification when the vegetation matures, the landscape is self-sustaining and the land can be returned to the government for public use.\n\nToday about 8 percent of the land disturbed by surface mining is considered reclaimed. According to approved reclamation plans for surface mines, the amount of reclaimed land will have increased six-fold by 2020 from its present level. Between 2020 and 2040 the land area reclaimed increases significantly, while the area disturbed remains the same size. To date the pace of land reclamation has been in line with expectations set forth in the projects\u2019 approved reclamation plans.\n\nThe burning of fuels as part of the production and upgrading of the oil sands results in air emissions that have an impact on local air quality. Air quality is monitored 24 hours a day, every day of the year in the oil sands region. Improved pollution controls and regulations, plus new technologies such as flue gas scrubbers, have reduced the emissions per barrel of pollutants that can cause smog and acid rain. The air quality in Fort McMurray, the closest urban area to the Athabasca oil sands, was rated \u201cgood\u201d 98 percent of the time during 2008. Air quality in the oil sands region is consistently rated better than in major Canadian cities such as Vancouver and Montreal.\n\nSince 1995, monitoring in the oil sands region indicates that four out of the five key air quality pollutants used to calculate the Air Quality Index show an improvement or no change in long-term air quality trends. Only nitrogen dioxide demonstrated an increasing trend. As well, air monitoring has shown increases in hydrogen sulphide in the Fort McMurray area and near oil sands upgraders (figures 9 and 10).\n\nIn 2009 the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) began releasing a series of reports on the state of biodiversity in the oil sands region of Alberta. Its first core report, \u201cThe State of Birds and Vascular Plants in Alberta\u2019s Lower Athabasca Planning Region,\u201d released in February 2009, found a 7 percent overall human footprint \u2014 3 percent for agriculture, 2 percent for foresting and 2 percent for energy. Biodiversity was 94 percent intact: birds were 94 percent and plants 95 percent intact.\n\nThere are two parts to the discussion of social aspects as they relate to oil sands. The first part deals with the importance of the oil sands to sustaining the quality of life in Canada. This includes job creation, both direct and indirect; the taxes and royalties levied on oil sands production that flow through government coffers, and the resources to fund equalization and other transfer payment programs. The second part deals with the immediate effect of oil sands development on the lives of those living and working adjacent to the resource.\n\nOne could argue that with the projected continual expansion of the oil sands and the relative decline of development and extraction of conventional sources of crude oil, the oil sands will occupy an increasingly important role in funding the social programs, including health care, that are so vital to Canadians\u2019 way of life and social well being.\n\nBut job creation and the taxes flowing through Canada\u2019s financial system that fund these vital programs have to be balanced with the other social issues arising from oil sands development and its effect on the day-to-day lives of those most directly affected. As well, development must be balanced with what has become known as \u201cthe social licence to operate\u201d \u2014 weighing private rights and the overall public good.\n\nIt is vitally important when considering the social licence to operate that First Nations treaty rights be respected. First Nations must be consulted on all development within the oil sands area.\n\nThere are 18 First Nations, with a combined population of 16,000 people, living on reserves; and 6 M\u00e9tis settlements, with approximately 6,000 residents, living within the oil sands area.\n\nThe \u201cduty to consult\u201d was introduced by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2004 and 2005, and it is currently the subject of ongoing litigation. No matter the outcome of these cases, cooperative engagement that meets the needs of industry and First Nations will be necessary under any scenario that envisages future oil sands development. Failing some form of cooperative engagement, oil sands development will slow down, putting in jeopardy the social well being that abundant energy has provided for Canadians.\n\nOn a positive note, in 2008 more than 1,500 Aboriginal people were directly employed in oil sands operations, about 10 percent of the oil sands workforce. In 2008 the value of contracts between Alberta oil sands companies and Aboriginal companies was $575 million, an increase of $150 million since 2006.\n\nIt is conventional wisdom that the environmental challenges raised by oil sands development will be met and overcome only through the development of \u201cgame changing\u201d or \u201ctransformative\u201d technology. The investment in CCS pilot projects by the federal and provincial governments; the Alberta Technology Fund; and the investment of government and industry in scientific research all speak to the importance placed on innovation.\n\nIndustry and government are also aware that oil sands challenges met in Canada through innovative technology will also form the base of \u201cgreen\u201d exports, especially to burgeoning markets in the developing world.\n\nRecent OECD reports on innovation in Canada make it clear that the government of Canada, industry and scientific researchers must become better at commercialization and technological development and implementation, moving technology from the scientific research laboratory to actual commercial and industrial use. In order to accomplish this, we must also get better at attracting venture capital to Canada to fund experimental research that leads to the needed innovations. In order to do this, partnerships among industry, government, scientific researchers and financial institutions are vital.\n\nOil sands research and development sponsored by the industry focuses on a number of vitally important areas for example, reducing water input, achieving the maximum recycling of water, using nonpotable water sources and finding multiple uses for water once it is in the system. Regarding in situ methods, processes are being tested for using less steam by employing solvents (propane) or a solvent and steam mixture. This requires less energy and therefore reduces GHG emissions. Research is also underway to achieve higher recycle rates for water in mines and in situ, resulting in less water input into the system.\n\nA secure energy future for Canadians is one in which energy development and investments in environmental protection are fully integrated, to the benefit of all Canadians. As the supply of conventional crude diminishes and becomes more difficult to access, the oil sands will have a crucial role to play in Canada\u2019s future energy security.\n\nWhile Canada is a net exporter of energy, enhancing our energy security must be addressed through the renewal of our aging energy transportation infrastructure \u2014 especially pipelines. Much of eastern Canada is dependent for oil on foreign imports. In fact, refineries in Quebec and the eastern provinces run primarily on imported crude oil. To reduce this vulnerability, pipelines would need to be reversed and extended, and the oil sands would be part of the mix needed to fill such pipelines. Energy security in Canada means more than providing energy to Canadians, it also means securing markets for the sale of our energy \u2014 especially from the oil sands \u2014 which means more jobs for Canadians. As a net exporter, and a country where a large percentage of GDP is dependent on energy production, Canada must discover and access new emerging markets. At present, Canada exports on average 1.88 million barrels of crude oil per day. In order to diversify markets for energy exports, especially to China, India, Japan and Korea, the necessary infrastructure will need to be built. Such infrastructure requires a long planning timeline, but when constructed it will assure Canada has access to markets other than the United States.\n\nSeveral recent reports deal with the role of oil sands in the relationship between Canada and the United States. Most notable are the Council of Foreign Relation\u2019s article \u201cThe Canadian Oil Sands: Energy Security vs. Climate Change,\u201d CERA\u2019s 2010 \u201cThe Role of Canadian Oil Sands in US Oil Supply,\u201d and CERI\u2019s 2009 \u201cThe Impacts of Canadian Oil Sands Development on the United States Economy.\u201d\n\nFrom the CERI report the following summary is instructive:\n\nCanada and the US are major trading partners, and the results clearly show significant economic benefits to the US from increased economic activity in Canada. As investment and production in oil sands ramps up in Canada, the pace of economic activity quickens and demand for US goods and services increase rapidly, resulting in an estimated 343,000 new US jobs between 2011 and 2015. Demand for US goods and services continues to climb through-out the period, adding an estimated $34 billion to US GDP in 2015, $40.4 billion in 2020 and $42.2 billion in 2025.\n\nStrategically, Canada is the leading supplier of foreign oil to the United States. Canada\u2019s share of US crude oil import rose from 15 percent in 2000 to 27 percent in 2009, underscoring the deep and growing economic and trading relationship. In the third quarter of 2009, the oil sands were the third largest source of crude oil imported into the United States. Energy imports from Canada can be characterized as superior to imports from elsewhere. Canada has an open oil and gas investment climate, the oil sands\u2019 capacity is not government controlled, their close proximity to US and a strict regulatory regime as well as capacity to increase oil sands supplies to the US all speak to this superiority.\n\nIt is obvious from the IEA\u2019s and CAPP\u2019s forecast for growth that increased production from Canada\u2019s oil sands will make an important contribution to fossil fuel supply through 2050.\n\nTherefore the contribution that further development of oil sands makes to the Canadian economy may well be secure for at least the foreseeable future. Revenues through royalties, taxes and job creation flow through Canada\u2019s economy, into equalization and social transfers from the federal to provincial governments. With increased development, the energy component of revenue flow through to Canadians would seem to be secure.\n\nHowever, as we try to balance energy and economy, the other leg of the three-legged stool is the environment, and the oil sands impact on it. There has been continuous improvement in environmental performance regarding GHG emissions reduction, movement to dry tailings and reduction in water use. The development of the oil sands has spurred on scientific research in a number of Canadian universities and other institutions. It is important for Canada and industry to accelerate the take-up of technological innovations and implement environmental performance improvements.\n\nThe prospect of oil sands development driving scientific research and technological innovations will, if successful, provide Canada with a platform to export our experience and new technology to the developing world. This is where the markets will be for Canadian products, if we take advantage through oil sands research to move to a greener economy.\n\nAchieving a balance between energy development, increased economic performance and environmental improvement should help support Canada\u2019s international position as an evolving green energy superpower.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nDo you have something to say about the article you just read?

            "search_summary": "Alberta oilsands spill hidden from First Nation an audacious act of \u2018environmental racism\u2019\u00a0\u00a0Canada's National Observer",
            "article_text": "\u201cThis is an outrageous act of environmental racism,\u201d Green Party co-leader Elizabeth May told Canada\u2019s National Observer. Her comments came the day after Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation Chief Allan Adam released a statement accusing Imperial Oil of hiding the massive spill from the nation. In two separate incidents, the wastewater spilled and seeped into the forest and wetland near the Muskeg and Firebag rivers, which flow into the Athabasca River.\n\nFederal politicians have joined the chorus of anger over Imperial Oil\u2019s failure to alert a downriver First Nations community of a massive release of oilsands tailings first reported last May.\n\nTailings are created through the mining and extraction of bitumen in Alberta\u2019s oilsands and are a thick, sludge-like mixture containing toxic naphthenic acids, arsenic and leftover remnants of bitumen, as well as silt, clay, and water. More than 1.4 trillion litres of treated tailings are stored on the banks of the Athabasca River in northern Alberta.\n\nChief Adam said his nation was unaware tailings from Imperial\u2019s Kearl site were spilling over and leaking into the ground, despite the fact the nation has a contract with Imperial Oil requiring the company inform them of such matters. Imperial Oil had multiple chances to share the news in person, Chief Adam said, but stayed silent until the provincial regulator issued an environmental protection order on Feb. 6.\n\nFederal politicians have joined the chorus of anger over Imperial Oil\u2019s failure to alert a downriver First Nations community of a massive release of oilsands tailings first reported last May. #AthabascaChipewyanFirstNation #Alberta\n\nIn a written statement, Imperial vice-president of oilsands mining Jamie Long acknowledged the community\u2019s \u201cconcerns about delays in receiving additional information\u201d and expressed regret to Chief Adam that the company\u2019s \u201ccommunications did not meet the expectations of the ACFN community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe further committed to him that we are taking the necessary steps to improve our communications so this does not happen again in the future,\u201d the statement reads, adding the company intended to share its findings when a cause and a plan of action were determined.\n\nThis \u201ccavalier public relations response\u201d is \u201coutrageous,\u201d said May. \u201cWhy are they apologizing for their communication style instead of for poisoning people and land and waters and wildlife?\u201d\n\nShe went on to say that Imperial Oil \u201cis not a responsible corporate citizen, as they like to pretend they are,\u201d but is actually one of the \u201cworst corporate criminals.\u201d\n\nNDP MP Blake Desjarlais said the situation \u201crequires a full public inquiry as to why these companies feel as though nine months of not warning the community that a dangerous chemical spill is taking place is something that's permissible in Canada.\u201d\n\nThe Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation sent a notice to all members warning them to avoid the Kearl site and stop eating any food collected after May 2022, according to Chief Adams\u2019 statement. According to a statement from Imperial Oil, its monitoring to date shows no reported impacts to wildlife and no measurable impact to local waterways.\n\nTo say that the release of tailings \u2014 one of the most poisonous, dangerous substances that can be produced from these sites \u2014 is not resulting in any ecological or environmental damage is \u201ca very far reach,\u201d said Desjarlais. \u201cI even go so far as to suggest that it's misleading to Canadians on the true damages and dangers of the release of tailings. Would the executive of Imperial Oil be happy to eat a fish that his tailings ponds went into?\u201d\n\nAlong with the seepage from four tailings ponds reported in May 2022, 5.3 million litres of water reportedly escaped from a tailings overflow drainage pond on Feb. 4, 2023, according to the Alberta Energy Regulator. Just imagine how much liquid has escaped in the nine months since the first violation, said Chief Adam.\n\nBloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MP Monique Pauz\u00e9 dubbed the news \u201can eloquent demonstration of the industry\u2019s lax attitude towards Native communities and the environment\u201d in an emailed statement to Canada\u2019s National Observer.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to qualify this as contempt,\u201d said Pauz\u00e9. \u201cThe substances released by this oilsands production are highly toxic: I am shocked, yet not surprised, by this lack of transparency and accountability.\u201d\n\nConservative environment critic G\u00e9rard Deltell declined to comment on the issue.\n\nImperial Oil\u2019s statement outlines some actions being taken to control the seepage, including installation of additional monitoring and pumping wells and \u201cwater collection measures.\u201d\n\nFederal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault released a statement Friday afternoon saying he is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the reports. Guilbeault goes on to say he reached out to Chief Adam and his provincial counterpart, Environment and Protected Areas Minister Sonya Savage, to \u201cget to the bottom of the situation\u201d and offered \u201cthe unwavering support of the federal government.\u201d\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada enforcement officers will be given all resources necessary to continue their independent assessment, under the federal Fisheries Act, to determine next steps, according to Guilbeault\u2019s statement. \u201cWe need to see a clear remediation plan from the company and to better understand the apparent failures of communication for the notification of this spill.\u201d\n\nTo Desjarlais, the situation echoes the mistakes and failures of past governments, in particular, the gutting of environmental protections by former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper.\n\nBill C-45 introduced sweeping changes to multiple laws, Desjarlais explained. It stripped the Navigable Waters Act of nearly all its protective measures, made amendments to the Fisheries Act and took away protections of Indigenous people under the Indian Act.\n\nThis was all done with omnibus Bill C-45 in 2012, which Desjarlais says is the root cause of the \u201cramrodding of resource projects that we're seeing today.\u201d\n\nAlberta Energy Regulator issued a statement saying it is the company's responsibility to report releases to affected or potentially affected parties as soon as they become aware of the release.\n\nDesjarlais disagrees with the regulator\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, it is the Crown government's responsibility, no matter if it's the province or the federal government ... to ensure that Indigenous people ... have their lands properly assessed and protected,\u201d he said.\n\nUnfortunately, Canada\u2019s federal laws don't accommodate the reality of these resource companies coming in and abusing public lands and public assets, he added. And the blame for that is not solely Harper\u2019s to bear \u2014 the current Liberal government knows the huge amendments that took place under Bill C-45, but we\u2019ve seen very little remedy to ensure that the protections of water in particular, under the Navigable Waters Act, were put back into place, Desjarlais said.\n\nWhen 71-year-old Alice Rigney heard the news that Imperial Oil failed to tell the nation about the tailings releases, she was \u201creally hurt\u201d and \u201cpissed off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believed there was a trust between us,\u201d Rigney, an Elder from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, told Canada\u2019s National Observer in an interview. \u201cAnd then this happens for nine months before they're finally found out\u2026 What does it tell you?\u201d\n\nShe said it hurts that Imperial Oil and industry more broadly make millions and billions of dollars destroying her peoples\u2019 land. \u201cI think to them a spill is, you know, really nothing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not nothing to Rigney and other Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation members who rely on the lands and waters to hunt, fish and gather sustenance. Her community has every right to be upset, especially because they\u2019ve had to make sacrifices and more or less go along with industry by way of contribution agreements in order to sustain themselves on the land, she said.\n\n\u201cAnd yet, we are still being lied to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my environment\u2026 This land was not given to us to destroy, this land was given to us by the Creator so that we could keep it for our grandchildren and for those yet to come \u2026 not plumb it the way industry is doing,\u201d said Rigney.\n\nShe recounts going fishing with her family on the Athabasca River in 1982 after a large oil spill from Suncor and watching her brother cook the fish over the campfire and seeing black fat dripping off their meal. When they tried the fish, it tasted like oil.\n\n\u201cI just wonder about those people at Imperial, how do they feel \u2026 when they go to bed at night and think, \u2018Oh, my. We did this to the environment and to the people downriver.\u2019 Do they even think about it?\u201d mused Rigney.\n\n\u201cIt's on their watch,\u201d she said.\n\nRigney hopes someday their grandchildren will ask them: \u201cWhy did you do this to the environment?\u201d\n\nNatasha Bulowski / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada\u2019s National Observer"

            "article_text": "CALGARY, AB, June 9, 2021 /CNW/ - Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus Energy, Imperial, MEG Energy and Suncor Energy formally announced today the Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero initiative. These companies operate approximately 90% of Canada's oil sands production. The goal of this unique alliance, working collectively with the federal and Alberta governments, is to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from oil sands operations by 2050 to help Canada meet its climate goals, including its Paris Agreement commitments and 2050 net zero aspirations.\n\nView PDF Canada\u2019s largest oil sands producers announce unprecedented alliance to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions (CNW Group/MEG Energy Corp.)\n\nThis collaborative effort follows welcome announcements from the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta of important support programs for emissions-reduction projects and infrastructure. Collaboration between industry and government will be critical to progressing the Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero vision and achieving Canada's climate goals.\n\nand the Government of of important support programs for emissions-reduction projects and infrastructure. Collaboration between industry and government will be critical to progressing the Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero vision and achieving climate goals. The Pathways vision is anchored by a major Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) trunkline connected to a carbon sequestration hub to enable multi-sector 'tie-in' projects for expanded emissions reductions. The proposed CCUS system is similar to the multi-billion dollar Longship/Northern Lights project in Norway as well as other CCUS projects in the Netherlands , U.K. and U.S., all of which involve significant collaboration between industry and government.\n\nas well as other CCUS projects in , U.K. and U.S., all of which involve significant collaboration between industry and government. The Pathways initiative is ambitious and will require significant investment on the part of both industry and government to advance the research and development of new and emerging technologies.\n\nThe companies involved look forward to continuing to work with the federal and Alberta governments, and to engaging with local Indigenous communities in northern Alberta to make this ambitious, major emissions-reduction vision a reality so those communities can continue to benefit from Canadian resource development.\n\nAs proud Canadian companies, members of the Pathways alliance share the aspiration of Canadians to find realistic and workable solutions to the challenge of climate change. The oil sands industry is a significant source of GHG emissions and the initiative will develop an actionable approach to address those emissions, while also preserving the more than $3 trillion in estimated oil sands contribution to Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) over the next 30 years. The initiative will create jobs, accelerate development of the clean tech sector, provide benefits for multiple other sectors and help maintain Canadians' quality of life. The members of the Pathways alliance will do their part by making the economic investments needed to ensure that our companies successfully make the transition to a net zero world, and hence, deliver long-term value to shareholders.\n\nBecause there is no single solution to achieving net zero emissions, the initiative incorporates a number of parallel pathways to address GHG emissions, including:\n\nA core Alberta infrastructure corridor linking oil sands facilities in the Fort McMurray and Cold Lake regions to a carbon sequestration hub near Cold Lake via a CO 2 trunkline. The trunkline would also be available to other industries in the region interested in capturing and sequestering CO 2 . There is also potential to link the infrastructure corridor to the Edmonton region.\n\ninfrastructure corridor linking oil sands facilities in the and regions to a carbon sequestration hub near via a CO trunkline. The trunkline would also be available to other industries in the region interested in capturing and sequestering CO . There is also potential to link the infrastructure corridor to the region. Deploying existing and emerging GHG reduction technologies at oil sands operations along the corridor, including CCUS technology, clean hydrogen, process improvements, energy efficiency, fuel switching and electrification.\n\nEvaluating, piloting and accelerating application of potential emerging emissions-reducing technologies including direct air capture, next-generation recovery technologies and small modular nuclear reactors.\n\nIn addition to collaborating and investing together with industry, it is essential for governments to develop enabling policies, fiscal programs and regulations to provide certainty for this type of long-term, large-scale investment. This includes dependable access to carbon sequestration rights, emissions reduction credits and ongoing investment tax credits. We look forward to continued collaboration with both the federal and Alberta governments to create the regulatory and policy certainty and fiscal framework needed to ensure the economic viability of this initiative.\n\nCanada is uniquely positioned to be a global leader in responsible oil production. The country has the world's third-largest oil reserves, some of the most stringent regulations and standards governing energy projects anywhere in the world, a strong track record for technology development and an established reputation of industry working together with Indigenous communities and municipalities. Members of the Pathways initiative believe the most effective way to address climate change is by developing and advancing new technologies and that this unprecedented challenge can and will be solved by Canadian ingenuity, leadership and collaboration.\n\nWhile alternative energy sources will play an increasingly important role in the decades ahead, all internationally recognized forecasts indicate fossil fuels will continue to be an essential requirement through 2050 and beyond as part of a diversified energy mix, including as a feedstock for carbon fibres, asphalt, plastics and other important products. That's why it's critical to take action now to ensure Canada takes its place as a leading supplier of responsibly produced oil to meet the world's demand for energy well into the future.\n\nQUOTES:\n\nGovernment of Alberta\n\n\"The Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero initiative is an industry driven, made-in-Alberta solution which will strengthen our position as global ESG leaders,\" said Sonya Savage, Alberta's Minister of Energy. \"Every credible energy forecast indicates that oil will be a major contributor to the energy mix in the decades ahead and even beyond 2050. Alberta is uniquely positioned and ready to meet that demand. This initiative will also pave the way for continued technological advancements, ultimately leading to the production of net zero barrels of oil.\"\n\nCanadian Natural Resources Limited\n\n\"Canada has an opportunity to lead on climate change by delivering meaningful emissions reductions as well as balancing sustainable economic development,\" said Tim McKay, Canadian Natural President. \"Canadian ingenuity has enabled oil sands development and with continued innovation, positions Canada to be the ESG-leading barrel to meet global energy demand. We are committed to working together with industry partners and governments to help meet Canada's climate objectives while providing sustainable long-term economic and social benefits for Canadians from the oil sands.\"\n\nCenovus Energy\n\n\"This collaborative effort amongst oil sands peers shows our serious commitment to global climate leadership,\" said Alex Pourbaix, Cenovus President and CEO. \"We are doing more than just talking about the need to play a role \u2013 we are taking bold action to address our emissions challenge and earn our spot as the supplier of choice to meet the world's growing demand for energy.\"\n\nImperial\n\n\"Canada has what it takes to be the responsible energy provider to the world,\" said Brad Corson, Imperial Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Canada's long-term success in achieving its climate goals lies in a collective commitment to innovation, global competitiveness, supportive public policy and open and ongoing dialogue on constructive solutions. Imperial is collaborating with others in industry and governments to develop and commercialize the breakthrough technologies that will reduce emissions and support society's net zero ambitions.\"\n\nMEG Energy\n\n\ufeff\"We are pleased to be part of this collaborative effort committed to the critical measures needed to achieve net zero green house gas emissions in the oil sands,\" said Derek Evans, President and Chief Executive Officer of MEG Energy. \"Bold action today demonstrates our commitment to tackling climate change and global climate leadership. This alliance working collectively with the federal and Alberta governments and all stakeholders will ensure that Canada continues to be a leading supplier to the world of responsibly produced oil.\"\n\nSuncor Energy\n\n\"Collaboration among companies, innovators and governments is critical to achieving ambitious goals. That's how we built a budding oil sands resource into one of the world's most reliable and ESG-leading oil basins in the world,\" said Mark Little, Suncor President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Canada - as one of the few jurisdictions with industrial-scale commercial CCUS projects in operation -- coupled with Alberta's abundant natural gas resources, geology and relevant technological expertise - is well positioned to lead in this area.\"\n\nAbout the Pathways initiative member companies\n\nCanadian Natural Resources Limited\n\nCanadian Natural Resources Limited (Canadian Natural) is a senior oil and natural gas production company, with continuing operations in its core areas located in Western Canada, the U.K. portion of the North Sea and Offshore Africa.

            "article_text": "Contentious changes to the federal Competition Act aimed at preventing corporate greenwashing leave lingering risks for investors of falling victim to false or exaggerated environmental claims, according to new research from an environmental law charity.\n\nDespite the legislation, under which companies could face financial penalties if their green assertions do not stand up to scrutiny, much of Canada\u2019s climate-conscious finance and environmental, social and governance (ESG) fields remain largely unregulated and open to greenwashing, the Quebec Environmental Law Centre said in a report set to be released Wednesday.\n\nEven areas in which compliance is currently mandatory have notable gaps that need to be addressed, the report said.\n\nThe act\u2019s shortcomings are compounded by the fact that voluntary guidelines around environmental disclosure and efforts to bolster it are being developed simultaneously by a number of self-governing and regulatory organizations and are in various stages of progress, with no central authority driving the process, said Julien Beaulieu, a law lecturer at the University of Sherbrooke and lead author of the report.\n\nYet despite the new legislation, without more detailed rules various programs and levels of regulation will risk sowing confusion among the investing public and could result in institutional and retail investors buying stocks and funds based on inaccurate assumptions of their overall environmental impact, Mr. Beaulieu said.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, everybody should play by the same rules under one unified set of standards, and the standards should be mandatory, not voluntary,\u201d Mr. Beaulieu said in an interview.\n\nEfforts under way include the Canadian Sustainability Standards Board\u2019s process to adapt international guidelines for climate and sustainability reporting to the domestic economy, and the expected move by the country\u2019s securities commissions to eventually include them in their regulations.\n\nIn addition, the federal government has been studying the draft for a green and transitionary taxonomy that would certify whether investments meet environmental standards, but has yet to produce a document to put into force. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault have been examining a taxonomy roadmap developed by an expert panel for the past two years.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a very clear and robust taxonomy,\u201d Mr. Beaulieu said. \u201cThat\u2019s the cornerstone of this whole financial policy and that\u2019s your working force, and then you need to harness different pieces of legislation around that working force.\u201d\n\nMark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England who recently accepted an economic adviser role for the federal Liberals, has also been vocal in criticizing Canada\u2019s patchwork approach to climate-related finance.\n\nThe controversial anti-greenwashing provision within the government\u2019s Bill C-59, enacted in June, makes changes to the Competition Act with the aim of forcing companies to prove their assertions of environmental performance. Individuals and companies could face sizable fines if found liable.\n\nThe government said corporate communications must be backed up by the as-yet-undefined international standards. The move has been lauded by climate activists.\n\nIn response to the act, several oil and gas companies and industry associations have added disclaimers to their websites and social-media feeds or deleted content. The Alberta government has been vociferous in its opposition to the amendment, calling the anti-greenwashing provision a \u201cgag order.\u201d\n\nThe Competition Bureau invited submissions as part of its consultation efforts, and is expected to release the results in the coming weeks.\n\nIn its submission, released publicly on Tuesday, the Business Council of Alberta said the legislation creates uncertainty that will result in years of decisions and legal judgements, and prevent companies from talking about their environmental actions and aspirations. That will restrict investment, and in turn limit hiring, it said.\n\nThe report makes several recommendations to improve the reliability of sustainable finance, including regulating new products and services such as voluntary carbon offsets, green and sustainability-linked bonds as well as ESG ratings services. All of those have come under scrutiny in recent years for insufficient information and disclosure. The centre also recommends strengthening labelling standards for investments.\n\nIt urges reinforcing rules for reporting environmental risks on, and the impacts of, the finance industry, including the metrics that back corporate assertions. Mr. Beaulieu said Europe\u2019s recent requirements to disclose data on double materiality \u2013 environmental risks to a company as well as its impact on the environment \u2013 would be an improvement.\n\nIn addition, the centre is calling for improved professional qualifications for financial advisers to bolster their knowledge of the topic, as the retail investors they serve tend to be the most vulnerable to greenwashing.\n\nJeffrey Jones writes about sustainable finance and the ESG sector for The Globe and Mail.

            "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: Wind turbines stand in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains near Pincher Creek, Alta., on June 6.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press\n\nThe federal government is proceeding with a long-awaited guidebook that certifies whether projects meet green and transitionary investment criteria \u2013 and leaving the door open for some natural gas to be included.\n\nAt Toronto\u2019s Principles for Responsible Investment conference on Wednesday, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said the \u201cmade-in-Canada taxonomy\u201d would start covering priority industrial sectors within the next 12 months, with the aim of providing investors with certainty that their capital is being spent on activities that meet clear climate objectives.\n\nThe green category includes projects with little to no carbon emissions, such as renewable energy; transition-related investments include projects that lower the climate impact of high-carbon industries. The government will appoint an arm\u2019s-length panel to assess whether industrial activities meet the overall goal of limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nMs. Freeland also said Ottawa will mandate climate-related financial disclosures for large, federally incorporated private companies. The move will allow investors to assess risks associated with climate change, she said.\n\nThe government will launch a regulatory process to determine what disclosures will be required and the size of companies that will have to conduct such reporting. It will entail making amendments to the Canada Business Corporations Act. Ms. Freeland said small- and medium-sized business will not be subject to the regulations, but will be encouraged to make such disclosures voluntarily.\n\nFor the taxonomy, the arm\u2019s-length panel will first focus on electricity, transportation, buildings, agriculture and forestry, manufacturing and extractives, including mineral extraction and processing, and natural gas, she said.\n\n\u201cThe external body that does this work is going to be expected to work hard with Canadian stakeholders. We\u2019re expecting them to work hard with industry, to work with Indigenous partners, to work with unions, to work with financial institutions,\u201d Ms. Freeland told an international audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to provide some additional support through the development phase.\u201d\n\nSustainable investment professionals have been laser-focused on the need for a taxonomy to help prevent greenwashing and attract the capital needed to meet the national net-zero emissions target. Ms. Freeland estimated that sum as high as $140-billion a year, up from the existing amount of $15-billion to $25-billion.\n\nMany in the industry have expressed disappointment over how long it has taken to move forward while other countries and jurisdictions have put similar documents into force. The announcement drew applause at Wednesday\u2019s event, which brought together Canadian and international investors.\n\nA taxonomy roadmap was completed two years ago by a financial-industry panel the government convened called the Sustainable Finance Action Council. It ended its work earlier this year with some frustration its work had not been formalized.\n\nOne sticking point was whether new natural gas production or expanded projects should be included in the document. The oil and gas industry and western provincial governments have pushed for gas to be covered by a taxonomy, but climate activists are adamant that fossil fuels have no place if it is to be credible in international markets.\n\nThe government said it does not anticipate new gas production will adhere to the 1.5 C criteria, but it left open the possibility that activities to reduce emissions from gas or \u201climited buildout\u201d of gas facilities could be covered if the output displaces more polluting fuels internationally. It said the new arm\u2019s-length panel will make that determination through its scientific research.\n\nBarbara Zvan, chief executive officer of University Pension Plan Ontario and one of the architects of the council\u2019s taxonomy roadmap, said she is pleased that the government is moving forward using most of the recommendations that her group made, including governance provided by an external panel. The natural gas stipulation is based on reducing emissions and not increasing production, she said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s science-aligned, keeping to 1.5 C, that\u2019s the key governance, and that\u2019s what makes it interoperable with everything else in the world,\u201d Ms. Zvan said.\n\nLaurel Collins, the environment critic of the New Democratic Party, said the announcements represent meaningful developments, but argued the guidebook should omit natural gas.\n\n\u201cIn the leadup to this, environmental experts and advocates have been really clear that we cannot label fossil fuels as sustainable. We can\u2019t allow the government to greenwash sustainable finance for the big banks and big oil companies,\u201d she said.\n\nJulie Segal, senior program manager of climate finance at Environmental Defence, an advocacy organization, said the taxonomy and disclosure rules are \u201cgentle steps\u201d and that much more is needed for the country to meet its climate targets, including requirements for companies to disclose their strategies for a low-carbon transition.\n\n\u201cWe need policies that align our financial system with climate action, and this isn\u2019t yet enough,\u201d she said."
