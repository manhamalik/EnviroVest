            "article_text": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Jamieson Wellness implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n\nA total of 12 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership\n\nUsing data from alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company\n\nEvery investor in Jamieson Wellness Inc. ( ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 45% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nNo shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 7.3% in value last week. Still, the 10% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Jamieson Wellness, beginning with the chart below.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Jamieson Wellness?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nJamieson Wellness already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Jamieson Wellness' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nIt looks like hedge funds own 15% of Jamieson Wellness shares. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. Mackenzie Financial Corporation is currently the company's largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 10.0% and 4.8% of the stock.\n\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Jamieson Wellness\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Jamieson Wellness Inc. in their own names. It seems the board members have no more than CA$11m worth of shares in the CA$1.4b company. We generally like to see a board more invested. However it might be worth checking\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 39% stake in Jamieson Wellness. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted you should be aware of.\n\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
