            "article_text": "Green tech, or green technology, generally refers to environmentally friendly technologies designed to reduce negative impacts on the planet through sustainable practices and innovation.\n\nGreen tech refers to a type of technology that is considered environmentally friendly based on its production process or its supply chain. Green tech\u2014an abbreviation of \"green technology\"\u2014can also refer to clean energy production, the use of alternative fuels, and technologies that are less harmful to the environment than fossil fuels.\n\nAlthough the market for green technology is relatively young, it has garnered a significant amount of investor interest due to increasing awareness about the impacts of climate change and the depletion of natural resources.\n\nKey Takeaways Green tech\u2013or green technology\u2013is an umbrella term that describes the use of technology and science to reduce human impacts on the natural environment.\n\nGreen technology encompasses a wide area of scientific research, including energy, atmospheric science, agriculture, material science, and hydrology.\n\nMany green technologies aim to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in order to prevent climate change.\n\nSolar power is one of the most successful green technologies and is now cheaper to deploy than fossil fuels in many countries.\n\nInvestors can support green technology by buying stocks, mutual funds, or bonds that support environmentally friendly technology.\n\nUnderstanding Green Tech\n\nGreen technology is an umbrella term that describes the use of technology and science to create products and services that are environmentally friendly. Green tech is related to cleantech, which specifically refers to products or services that improve operational performance while also reducing costs, energy consumption, waste, or negative effects on the environment.\n\nThe goal of green tech is to protect the environment, repair damage done to the environment in the past, and conserve the Earth's natural resources. Green tech has also become a burgeoning industry that has attracted enormous amounts of investment capital.\n\nThe use of green tech can be a stated goal of a business segment or a company. These goals are typically outlined in a company's environmental, sustainability, and governance (ESG) statement, or can even be found in the mission statement of a firm. Increasingly, socially responsible investors are looking to narrow down their prospective investments to only include companies that specifically employ or produce green technologies.\n\nThe $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden on Nov. 15, 2021, earmarked substantial allocations for green tech. These include the largest investment in clean energy transmission and electric vehicle infrastructure in history, electrifying thousands of school and transit buses across the country, and creating a new authority to build a resilient, clean, electric grid. However, President Trump froze funding for the Jobs Act's clean energy projects shortly after his re-election.\n\nHistory of Green Tech\n\nWhile green tech has become increasingly popular in the modern age, elements of these business practices have been in use since the Industrial Revolution. Beginning in the early 19th century, scientists began to observe the ecological impacts of coal-burning industrial plants, and manufacturers have sought to reduce their negative environmental externalities by altering production processes to produce less soot or waste byproducts.\n\nIn the United States, one of the most important milestones was World War II. In order to reduce consumption and waste, more than 400,000 volunteers began collecting metal, paper, rubber, and other materials for the war effort.\n\nFollowing the war, scientists like Rachel Carson began warning of the consequences of chemical pesticides, while doctors abroad reported mysterious illnesses associated with nuclear radiation. Many point to this era as the genesis of the ecological movement, which sought to preserve ecosystems and resources while raising awareness of the consequences of runaway technology.\n\nGovernment bodies slowly recognized the importance of protecting environmental resources. Curbside recycling programs became common over the following decades, raising awareness about household waste. The Environmental Protection Agency, established in 1970, set firm requirements on pollution and waste and established mandates for coal scrubbers and other clean technologies.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, the first major recycling program was launched during World War II. Nearly half a million volunteers pitched in, recycling tens of thousands of tons of waste to help the war effort.\n\nTypes of Green Tech\n\nGreen technology is a broad category that encompasses several forms of environmental remediation. While climate change and carbon emissions are now considered among the most pressing global issues, there are also many efforts to address local environmental hazards. Some seek to protect specific ecosystems or endangered species. Others seek to conserve scarce natural resources by finding more sustainable alternatives.\n\nAlternative Energy\n\nIn order to provide a viable alternative to fossil fuels, many businesses are seeking to engineer alternative sources of energy that do not generate atmospheric carbon. Solar and wind power are now among the most inexpensive sources of energy, and solar panels are affordable to U.S. homeowners at a consumer scale. Other alternatives, such as geothermal and tidal energy, have yet to be deployed at scale.\n\nElectric Vehicles\n\nNearly a third of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are released by transportation activities, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Many manufacturers are exploring ways to reduce automotive emissions, either by designing more fuel-efficient engines or shifting to electrical power.\n\nHowever, electric vehicles require a host of innovations in other spheres, such as high-capacity rechargeable batteries and charging infrastructure. In addition, the benefits of electric vehicles are limited by the fact that many power grids still rely on fossil fuels.\n\nSustainable Agriculture\n\nFarming and livestock have a substantial environmental footprint, from the high costs of land and water usage to the ecological consequences of pesticides, fertilizers, and animal waste. As a result, there are many opportunities for green technology in the area of agriculture. For example, organic farming techniques can reduce the damage due to soil exhaustion, innovations in cattle feed can reduce methane emissions, and meat substitutes can reduce the consumption of livestock.\n\nRecycling\n\nRecycling seeks to conserve scarce resources by reusing materials or finding sustainable substitutes. While plastic, glass, paper, and metal waste are the most familiar forms of recycling, more sophisticated operations can be used to recover expensive raw materials from e-waste or automobile parts.\n\nCarbon Capture\n\nCarbon capture refers to a group of experimental technologies that seek to remove and sequester greenhouse gases, either at the point of combustion or from the atmosphere. This technology has been heavily promoted by the fossil fuel industry, although it has yet to deliver on those expectations. The largest carbon capture facility can absorb 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year, a minuscule amount compared to annual emissions.\n\n71% The amount of new energy capacity that comes from wind and solar power.\n\nAdoption of Green Tech\n\nWhile green tech is a broad and hard-to-define category, some types of green technology have experienced wide adoption. Several countries have launched initiatives to eliminate single-use plastics, a goal that would require sizeable investments in alternatives, such as paper substitutes, bioplastics, or recycling technologies. Singapore, for example, has pledged to reach 70% recycling by 2030.\n\nRenewable energy is another frontier for green tech adoption, with fossil fuels recognized as a significant driver for climate change. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar and wind power together will account for 71% of the new energy capacity added in 2024. Worldwide, global investment in all renewable energy sources exceeded $3 trillion in 2024.\n\nDo Benefits Outweigh the Costs?\n\nWhile green technologies have the shared goal of preserving biodiversity and conserving the earth's resources, there are few ways to do so without affecting the environment in other ways. In some cases, reducing environmental costs in one area means causing adverse impacts in another.\n\nFor example, the batteries in electric vehicles rely on lithium, an element that is often strip-mined from South American rain forests. Hydroelectric dams have low carbon emissions, but high impacts on the salmon and other species that rely on those waterways. Green energy devices\n\nsuch as solar panels and wind turbines require a host of rare minerals, that can only be extracted with the use of toxic chemicals.\n\nThis does not necessarily mean that green technology is a lost cause, but it does require careful accounting to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\n\n\nObstacles to the Adoption of Green Tech\n\nThere are several obstacles to adopting green technology, including the high initial costs. Developing and implementing sustainable technologies often requires significant investments that deter many businesses and consumers. Additionally, the lack of financial incentives and subsidies can make it challenging for smaller entities to bear the upfront expenses, slowing down the overall pace of green tech adoption.\n\nAnother major hurdle is the insufficient infrastructure to support new green technologies. Many regions lack the necessary facilities. This inadequate support network hampers the efficient use of green tech, making it less attractive to potential adopters. Additionally, existing policies and regulations often lag behind technological advances, further complicating widespread implementation.\n\nSupply chain challenges have also been an obstacle, including a shortage of transformers that are needed to connect clean energy to the grid.\n\nIs Green Tech a Growth Industry?\n\nGreen technology is undoubtedly a growth industry driven by increasing global awareness and the urgent need for sustainable solutions. As governments and organizations prioritize environmental policies, investments in clean energy, electric vehicles, and sustainable agriculture are booming. This surge in funding and innovation highlights the sector's potential for rapid expansion and possibly long-term profitability.\n\nSolar power was the fastest-growing power source in the U.S. in 2025. A record 37 gigawatts (GW) of solar energy capacity was installed in the U.S. in 2024, almost double the figure from 2023.\n\n\n\nMoreover, consumer demand for eco-friendly products and services is high, propelling the green tech market forward. In a 2020 McKinsey survey, more than 60% of respondents said they\u2019d pay more for a product with sustainable packaging. Another study by McKinsey and NielsenIQ found that products making ESG-related claims saw more sales growth from 2017 to 2022, averaging 28% cumulative growth, compared to 20% growth for products that made no ESG-related claims.\n\nCompanies that adopt and develop green technologies can potentially gain competitive advantages, attracting both customers and investors. This growing interest not only boosts industry revenue but also encourages further advancements, establishing green tech as a cornerstone of future economic growth.\n\nWhat Is the Cheapest Form of Green Energy? The cheapest form of alternative energy is solar power, according to the International Energy Agency. In its 2020 World Outlook Report, the Agency found that photovoltaic solar energy is \"consistently cheaper than new coal- or gas-fired power plants in most countries, and solar projects now offer some of the lowest-cost electricity ever seen.\"\n\nHow Do You Invest in Green Technology? The easiest way to invest in green tech is to buy stock in companies that are making major bets on environmentally-friendly technologies. Investors can attempt to identify individual stocks, or simply invest in a mutual fund, index fund, or another instrument that seeks to reflect the broader market for environmental investments. The advantage to the latter approach is that the investor will gain diversified exposure to the green tech industry, rather than the fortunes of a single company.\n\nIs Nuclear Power Green? Nuclear power is a deeply controversial subject, and many scientists have disputed its benefits. Although nuclear power derived from fission can provide reliable, inexpensive electricity without greenhouse gases, it also produces highly radioactive waste that must be stored for thousands of years. Some activists have argued that nuclear power can never be safely generated, and a number of high-profile accidents\u2014notably at Chernobyl and Fukushima\u2014have highlighted these concerns. However, it should also be noted that the combined death toll from nuclear accidents is far lower than the annual fatalities from fossil fuel pollution.\n\nWhat Is the Main Purpose of Green Tech? The main purpose of green tech is to promote sustainability and minimize environmental degradation through innovative technical solutions.\n\nWhich Country Has the Most Green Technology? Norway\u2014along with its Nordic counterparts, such as Sweden and Denmark\u2014is recognized globally for pioneering green tech, renewable energy, and sustainable resource management.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nGreen tech is a growing industry that has drawn significant interest and investments in recent years, driven by increasing concern over climate change and the depletion of natural resources around the world. Green tech involves the creation and use of alternative fuels and less-harmful technologies, aiming to protect the environment, repair environmental damage, and conserve the Earth's natural resources."

            "article_text": "1. In 2020, we raised our aspiration to reduce emissions in our operations (Scopes 1 & 2) by realigning our science-based target to a 1.5o-C-aligned trajectory. Our goal is to achieve zero emissions across Walmart\u2019s global operations by 2040, reducing absolute Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions 35% by 2025 and 65% by 2030 from our 2015 base year (interim targets approved as science-based and classified as 1.5\u00b0C-aligned by the SBTi. We anticipate achieving our near- and mid-term emissions reduction targets later than our 2025 and 2030 target dates while working to achieve our 2040 zero emissions aspiration, as further discussed in this brief.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. As used herein, \u201crenewable sources of energy\u201d means renewable sources of electricity and is not intended to cover other sources of energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Annual Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions and carbon intensity metrics are updated from time to time in this Climate Change brief to account for changes in emission factors or the availability of more accurate activity data. Our emissions footprint in CO2e and carbon intensity per revenue are calculated to include emissions for our operations for the period which we owned the operations in the reporting year. This may result in updated emissions reported in this Climate Change brief not corresponding to results reported to CDP for our annual Climate Change questionnaire. We engage Lucideon CICS to independently verify Walmart\u2019s reported Scope 1 & 2 emissions as reported to CDP annually, pursuant to ISO 14064-3 (the international standard for verification of Greenhouse Gas inventories). We follow Walmart\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Inventory Methodology in calculating our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which is consistent with the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative (the \u201cGHG Protocol\u201d) for corporate GHG accounting and reporting. We also define Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions as per GHG Protocol guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. To account for structural changes in our business, we strive to adjust our emission reduction progress on Scope 1 & 2 emissions to add or subtract emissions for entities acquired or divested in the year the acquisition or divestiture took place, including adjusting for previous years (including the baseline year).\n\n\n\n5. This includes generation from active renewable and low-carbon projects. It considers the combined contribution of power generated from on-site and off-site projects as well as renewable energy generation feeding into the grids where our sites are located. The electricity procured from our renewable energy projects and the most recent grid fuel mix information obtained from the International Energy Agency for the regions where we operate. The CY2021 estimate does not include energy data for our Flipkart business. We believe excluding CY2021 Flipkart data will have a negligible impact on our estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Calculated in accordance with Walmart\u2019s Project Gigaton Accounting Methodology, available on the Walmart Sustainability Hub. This result includes emissions that may only be avoided, reduced, or sequestered after FY2024. In accordance with Walmart\u2019s Project Gigaton Accounting Methodology, the emissions impact of projects and initiatives with an estimated lifespan of more than one year are accounted for in the year they are reported, up to and including anticipated emissions impacts in 2030.\n\n\n\n7. Because Walmart does not restrict suppliers to reporting only on emissions avoidance and reduction efforts that are attributable to the suppliers\u2019 business with Walmart, actions taken and reported through Project Gigaton cannot be used to measure Walmart\u2019s Scope 3 emissions, either absolutely or in year-over-year reductions.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Walmart fiscal years run from February 1 to January 31 and are denoted by \u201cFY\u201d in our reporting (e.g., FY2023 is the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023). Calendar years are noted in four-digit format or by \u201cCY\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n9. The U.S. product net sales used for the calculation includes Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club product net sales for the four preceding quarters prior to survey reporting window (Q3 through Q2). The percentage represents U.S. product net sales of suppliers that reported to Project Gigaton in the reporting year versus all U.S. product net sales. The calculation excludes Walmart International segment product net sales from the calculation. Reporting suppliers represents suppliers who have answered one or more of the questions in Project Gigaton in the reporting year.\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Calculated in accordance with the RE100 technical criteria. RE100 defines renewable electricity consumption as the ability to make unique claims on the use of renewable electricity generation and its attributes.\n\n\n\n\n\n11. For further information, visit the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Alternative Fuels Data Center\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Alongside our Project Gigaton 1 billion metric ton goal, in 2018, Walmart set a sub-goal to reduce emissions by 50 MMT in our China value chain. In February 2024, we announced that our suppliers have reported projects that are expected to exceed 1 billion metric tons of cumulative emissions reduced, avoided, or sequestered by 2030. We retired our China sub-goal upon achievement of our primary Project Gigaton goal to enable a refocus of effort and attention on our Scope 3 footprint and work plan going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Sum of single year reported emissions may not add up to cumulative reported emissions due to rounding.\n\n\n\n\n\n14. WWF and EDF review select suppliers' submissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n15. We caution against comparing year-over-year Scope 3 footprints from 2017-2021, as the scope and methodology used to estimate those footprints has evolved. Scope 3 footprints beginning in 2022 allow for greater comparison, as the methodology is consistent and includes the same GHG Protocol categories (1, 2, 11, and 12).\n\n\n\n\n\n16. For additional information on the complexity of Scope 3 measurement, accounting and reporting challenges, please see Retailers\u2019 climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chains\n\n17. Estimated Scope 3 emissions for GHG Protocol Categories 1, 2, 11, and 12 include key markets and represents >90% of Walmart\u2019s comprehensive Scope 3 footprint. Key markets include U.S., Mexico, India (Flipkart), Canada and China.\n\n\n\n\n\n18. Changes in disclosure regulations, carbon accounting methodologies (e.g., GHG Protocol) and data availability may impact our footprint and progress towards our target. GHG Protocol Category 11 includes the total lifetime emissions from products sold in the reporting year, not just the emissions from their use in that year.\n\n\n\n\n\n19. Scope 3 carbon intensity (reported Scope 3 MMT CO2e emissions per $B net sales for Walmart Inc.) calculation is based on calendar year emissions (January 1-December 31) and normalized by total annual net sales as measured by Walmart\u2019s fiscal year (February 1-January 31)."

            "article_text": "Technology is reforming how businesses operate due to everything from smart manufacturing systems to AI-driven supply chains.\n\nHowever, the true potential of digital transformation lies in its ability to drive meaningful progress towards meeting sustainability goals.\n\nMalaysian firms are leading the way in integrating digital innovation with ESG initiatives, via various approaches and initiatives.\n\nDigital transformation is not limited to the integration of digital tools as a means to driving internal operational efficiencies and productivity.\n\nFor example, digital transformation has shifted the dial in reshaping inherently traditional industries to create new customer experiences, or even business models, through the introduction of digital products and services.\n\nFrom everyday apps like digital banking and ride hailing services, to integrated superapps that enable users to book flights, accommodation and travel insurance all at the same time, and smart manufacturing systems that reduce waste or artificial intelligence (AI)-driven supply chains that optimize resource allocation, technology is revolutionizing how businesses access different markets and customers.\n\nNonetheless, as organizations make the shift to digitalize services and digitize processes, through innovation and well-focussed leadership, they can drive meaningful impact through digital transformation by balancing people, the planet and profit.\n\nGlobally, corporations are beginning to realize that environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles can no longer be sidelined. Consumers, investors, and regulators are increasingly holding businesses accountable for their environmental and social impacts.\n\nIn Europe, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) has set new standards for corporate transparency and accountability, requiring companies to disclose their ESG practices in greater detail.\n\nAnd in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed new rules for climate-related disclosures by public companies and investors, reflecting the increasing importance of ESG in investment decision-making.\n\nMeanwhile, in Asia, countries like Japan, Malaysia and Singapore are leading the charge with robust ESG guidelines and a strong focus on corporate governance.\n\nThis shift in expectations has prompted companies to explore innovative ways to gather high quality data to reduce their carbon footprints, manage resources more efficiently, and uphold social responsibility. Digital technologies, with their capacity to gather, analyze and act on vast amounts of data, are emerging as indispensable tools in this endeavour.\n\nFor instance, AI can be integrated in existing data systems to predict and mitigate environmental risks, such as optimizing energy consumption in real-time to reduce emissions. Similarly, automation processes can create leaner operational processes, subsequently reducing waste and improving the overall sustainability of production systems.\n\nThe integration of digital solutions into ESG strategies is not just about compliance; it\u2019s about positioning businesses as leaders in the transition to a greener economy and creating new competitive advantages for the organization and/or industry.\n\nLeading in digital sustainability\n\nWhile the global landscape is shifting, Malaysia is taking bold steps to position itself as a leader in this space. The country\u2019s commitment to integrating digital innovation with ESG initiatives is evident in its national policies and corporate practices.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s leadership role is further highlighted by its proactive efforts to align with global sustainability goals while fostering an environment conducive to technological innovation.\n\nA clear example is Bursa Malaysia, one of the largest bourses in Southeast Asia, which requires publicly listed companies to disclose their sustainability practices in their annual reports, a move that signals the growing importance of ESG considerations in corporate governance.\n\nThis not only ensures transparency but also drives companies to align their operations with global sustainability standards, and consequently nudging publicly-listed companies' supply chains to follow suit. The requirement for detailed ESG reporting is pushing Malaysian companies to innovate and adopt technologies that enhance sustainability and resource efficiency.\n\nAs a result, several prominent Malaysian companies have already taken significant steps in integrating ESG principles into their operations, often leveraging digital technologies to enhance their impact. These include:\n\nMaybank: One of Southeast Asia's largest financial institutions, Maybank, has been at the forefront of integrating ESG into its business strategy. The bank\u2019s 2022 sustainability report highlights its use of data analytics to assess the environmental and social impacts of its operational activities. Maybank has also increased its initial commitment of mobilizing MYR50 billion ($11.3 billion) in sustainable finance by 2025 to MYR80 billion ($18 billion), focusing on sectors that contribute to a low-carbon economy.\n\nSD Guthrie Berhad (formerly known as Sime Darby Plantation): As one of the world\u2019s largest palm oil producers, SD Guthrie has implemented a robust sustainability strategy that includes leveraging digital tools for better resource management. The company uses satellite imagery and AI to monitor its plantations, ensuring that deforestation and other environmentally harmful practices are minimized. This approach not only helps the company meet its ESG targets but also improves transparency with stakeholders.\n\nTenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB): Malaysia\u2019s largest electricity utility company, TNB, is actively pursuing a transition to renewable energy. The company has launched various initiatives to reduce carbon emissions, including the deployment of smart grids and AI-powered energy management systems. These digital technologies help optimize energy distribution and reduce wastage, contributing to TNB\u2019s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nCatalyzing change through action\n\n\n\nTechnology is crucial in advancing Malaysia\u2019s ESG journey, with the public sector actively participating. On top of introducing the Enhanced Sustainability Disclosure Framework in 2022, Bursa Malaysia also introduced digital tools that help companies meet their ESG reporting requirements, particularly the Centralised Sustainability Intelligence (CSI) solution which provides tools for assessing carbon emissions across value chains and streamlining sustainability reporting \u2013 ultimately facilitating access to green financing and new markets.\n\nAnother example of Malaysia leading through action in this space is the recently launched Malaysia Centre4IR ESG Innovation Challenge, an UpLink affiliate challenge organized by the Malaysia Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This initiative exemplifies how innovation and partnerships can drive significant progress towards sustainability.\n\nThis initiative also aligns with Bursa Malaysia's Public Listed Companies Transformation (PLCT) Programme, which promotes best practices in digital transformation and ESG adoption, with the aim of propelling corporate Malaysia towards higher performance, fostering a dynamic environment that attracts both local and global investors.\n\nThe challenge invites innovators from around the world to propose groundbreaking projects that leverage digital technologies such as automation, AI and data analytics to minimize environmental impact and advance ESG goals.\n\nLoading...\n\nWith corporate partners like CJ Century Logistics, Globetronics, Maybank, REDtone Digital, and Sunway iLabs, the challenge offers a platform for collaboration between innovators and industry leaders, paving the way for the implementation of sustainable solutions.\n\nThe opportunity to pilot these solutions with leading Malaysian companies, representing key sectors in the country, not only provides a real-world testing ground but also accelerates the adoption of technologies that can set new levels or approaches in sustainability across industries.\n\nDriving sustainable progress through innovation\n\nThe intersection of digital transformation and ESG is a powerful catalyst for sustainable progress. As companies around the world embrace this convergence, they unlock new opportunities to reduce their environmental impact, optimize resource use and set industry best practices that align with global sustainability goals.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s leadership in this area, exemplified by initiatives like the Malaysia Centre4IR ESG Innovation Challenge, Bursa Malaysia\u2019s ESG reporting requirements and tools and the innovative practices of leading Malaysian companies, demonstrates how countries and corporations can work together to drive meaningful change.\n\nBy integrating digital innovation with ESG principles, businesses can not only meet the demands of an increasingly eco-conscious market but also contribute to a more sustainable future for all."

            "article_text": "Reforming public procurement can have a dramatic impact. By setting strict green criteria for contracts, governments can improve their own carbon footprint through the use of greener products and services while encouraging other actors to improve their own sustainable consumption and production practices. Governments may have to overcome negative perceptions (for example, that green products and services are more expensive), and will certainly need to train public procurers, sustainability officers and project managers in sustainable procurement.\n\nGovernments can set the pace for sustainability reporting by highlighting the environmental impact of their spending. Efforts will need to be made to harmonize the multiple existing frameworks for sustainability reporting and tailor them for public sector needs. Through advanced data capture and analysis, governments can enhance their impact monitoring and reporting, at the same time upskilling staff with appropriate data capabilities. Mandatory reporting creates a sense of urgency, and independent third-party organizations, including national audit offices, should audit reports and recommend improvements.\n\nThe Nordic countries are emerging as leaders in sustainability reporting. Finland\u2019s State Treasury published new guidance in September 2021, recommending that all ministries, agencies, and institutions produce an annual sustainability report on their societal and global impacts.40 The municipality of Herning in Denmark has voluntarily released \"green\" accounts since 2012. These cover procurement, recycling and waste, nature and green areas, municipal properties, planning and private construction, transport and energy consumption.41 The initiative has been given added impetus by the DK2020 project, which supports 20 municipalities in developing, upgrading or adjusting climate action efforts, in line with the Paris Agreement goals.42\n\nPromote a whole-of-society and people-centered approach\n\nThe huge and complex challenge of climate change inevitably demands collaboration from every individual and organization across society. The initial momentum for the energy transition in the Netherlands, for example, started in 2013 with the Energy Agreement for Sustainable Growth, bringing together government, industry, trade unions and the third sector to shape the country\u2019s plans. Over time this led to the country\u2019s national climate commitments in 2018, again working with labor unions, NGOs, business associations and local authorities to confirm targets.43\n\nCitizens have a crucial role to play in tackling climate and environmental problems by changing their behavior and informing policymakers of their views. Research shows that people are willing to make changes in their own lives if they see this as part of a wider national effort to cut emissions.44 More participatory forms of public engagement, such as online deliberation and citizens assemblies, help involve people in problem-solving and climate action policy. An analysis of climate assemblies in France and the UK suggests citizens generate far more ambitious policies than politicians, having a significant and immediate effect on climate policy.45\n\nGovernments can also do more to educate people on the impact of their lifestyle choices, nudging them towards more sustainable consumption and behavior \u2014 such as ethical investment, electric vehicles, retrofitting homes or changing diets. Researchers from INSEAD and the University of Southern California surveyed a wide range of behavioral experiments linked to green issues, concluding that nudges don\u2019t just promote eco-friendly behavior; they may also be more effective than government communications.46\n\nBut there can be no one-size-fits-all approach for citizens. Meeting climate goals brings costs for all individuals, whether as taxpayers, billpayers, shareholders, workers in carbon-emitting industries or consumers of carbon-intensive products. The poorest households, where energy bills are a higher proportion of household spending, often suffer the most from the transition in terms of higher fuel prices and costly conversions.\n\nA \"just\" transition can ensure that costs and benefits are fairly distributed. This requires government investment and support, including subsidies and exemptions, and careful targeting of interventions to avoid adverse outcomes. Such policies could generate social and economic benefits that reduce poverty and address gender, health and economic inequalities.47\n\nFinally, governments cannot ignore communities who stand to lose out from the green transition, such as coal miners and oil workers. Support will be needed to diversify the economy in regions where jobs or livelihoods are at risk and to help provide new green employment opportunities. The UK\u2019s Humber region has become a \"cluster\" for offshore wind, helping revitalize the region after a period of economic decline. The area is now home to six operational offshore wind farms, with a range of new jobs in renewable energy plants, as well as manufacturing and other high-skill positions."

            "article_text": "Harnessing the infinite power of ocean waves and tides has been a long, slow slog, but the waiting could be over. Democratic members of the House of Representatives have come up with a $1 billion scheme to launch the US marine energy industry into the big leagues, to take its rightful place alongside the wind and solar juggernauts pushing the rnewable energy industry.\n\n$1 Billion For Marine Energy\n\nThe big question is whether or not US lawmakers will approve a new $1 billion funding package for the marine energy industry. That depends on who wins which elections, so hold on to your hats.\n\nIn the meantime, it\u2019s no surprise to find a group of Democratic Representatives from coastal states behind the new measure, including Nanette Barrag\u00e1n (CA) and Suzanne Bonamici (OR) who introduced the new bill under the title, \u201cMarine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act.\u201d\n\nAlso lining up in support were Democratic representatives Ed Case (HI), Rashida Tlaib (MI.), Kevin Mullin (CA), Val Hoyle (OR), Troy Carter (LA), Salud Carbajal (CA), and Anne Kuster (NH).\n\nIn terms of marine energy and coastal states, Tlaib would appear to be an outlier until you recall that thing about Lake Michigan. Researchers from the Graham Sustainability Institute at the University of Michigan have already embarked on a significant wave energy assessment for Beaver Island in Lake Michigan.\n\nAbout 600 permanent residents live on Beaver Island. They currently depend on \u201cfragile power connections and diesel generators\u201d as described by the research team.\n\nThe researchers anticipate that the wave energy project will have an impact far beyond the residents of Beaver Island. \u201cThe project is designed to be highly transferable, with the potential to benefit thousands of islands across the U.S. facing similar energy challenges,\u201d they emphasize.\n\nThe focus on island communities also reflects insights shared at an energy conference at The Hague last year. Participants noted that energy planners in remote locations are not solely focused on the cheapest forms of energy. Reliability and sustainability also have value, in addition to the local quality-of-life improvements that occur when noisy, polluting diesel generators are pushed out of the picture.\n\nIn addition, the Energy Department has organized a network of wave and current testing facilities of various sorts all over the US through its TEAMER initiative. Jobs, education and other activities related to those facilities could help motivate other lawmakers in non-coastal states to support the Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act.\n\nA Place In The Sun For Marine Energy\n\nMarine energy advocates point out that, by the numbers, their favorite form of renewable energy has some significant advantages over wind and solar power.\n\nThe numbers are impressive. \u201cWater moves naturally all around the world and provides a multitude of opportunities to harness energy for our power grid,\u201d the Energy Department explains, including interior waterways along with oceans.\n\n\u201cThe power coursing through oceans and rivers equates to nearly 60% of the United States\u2019 total electricity needs,\u201d they add.\n\nWave and tidal devices remove land use conflicts from the negotiating table, though they can still run into objections from commercial fishers and other maritime stakeholders. Those conflicts aside, marine energy devices sit low above, or entirely underneath, the surface of the water, negating the \u201ceyesore\u201d objections to offshore wind turbines.\n\nRep. Barrag\u00e1n also notes that marine energy facilities can generate power locally at population centers. \u201cNearly 40 percent of the U.S. population lives in coastal communities where marine energy resources are abundant and offer tremendous potential to power our communities with clean, renewable energy,\u201d Barrag\u00e1n explained in a press statement earlier this week.\n\nCleanTechnica has been keeping tabs on federal government\u2019s support for the US marine energy industry, which includes a wave energy test site located at a US military facility in Hawaii, set up back in 2010. That facility has been upgraded several times since then. More recently, an ambitious new open-water test site on the Oregon coast has also added to the nation\u2019s support for marine energy innovators. A new $1 billion funding pot would build on these resources.\n\nThe Marine Energy Industry Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels\n\nAside from generating clean kilowatts sometime in the future, the marine energy industry has already attracted a substantial amount of economic activity in the US here and now.\n\nThe list of private firms, organizations and other stakeholders on record in support of the Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act includes several that have crossed the CleanTechnica radar, including CalWave, Eco Wave Power, Emrgy, Ocean Renewable Power Company, Ocean Power Technologies, and Verdant Power.\n\nOther supporters cited by the lawmakers are the Altasea innovation and business campus at the Port of Los Angeles, Anacapa Wave, Aquantis, Atlantic Marine Energy Center, Biosonics, Bluewater Network, C-Power, Cardinal Engineering, DLZ Corporation, Ecomerit, FluxMagic Inc., Hawaii Marine Energy Center, Hydrokinetic Energy Corp., Littoral Power, Marine Energy Council, National Hydropower Association, Ocean Conservancy, Ocean Energy USA Inc., Oscilla Power, Pacific Environment, Pacific Marine Energy Center, Pacific Ocean Energy Trust, PacWave, PB Mechanical Consulting Service, Southeast National Marine Renewable Energy Center, Streamwise Development, Tidal Energy Corp., Tide Mill Institute, Thompson Metal Fab, Triton Systems, Water Bros Diesel, and 3U Technologies.\n\nAnd The First Onshore Marine Energy Test Will Be \u2026\n\nOne other thing that characterizes the marine energy field is the startling array of different systems aimed at harvesting the natural movement of water. That is especially evident in the tidal energy field, where designs range from compact turbines discretely tethered to the seabed, on up to massive infrastructure projects such as the proposed barrage-type tidal project in the UK.\n\nOn the wave energy side, most of the devices to cross the CleanTechnica radar are buoy-type systems designed for open-ocean use, providing for the opportunity to piggyback them with offshore wind farms and other maritime infrastructure.\n\nWave energy devices can also be attached to seawalls, piers, and other onshore infrastructure. The Israeli startup Eco Wave Power has come up one such energy harvesting system. It is currently being installed at the AltaSea campus at the Port of Los Angeles, in partnership with Shell MRE. Once in operation, it will be the first onshore pilot project to demonstrated an onshore wave energy system.\n\nShell MRE has also partnered with the Danish startup Wavepiston, which has come up with a unique design that vaguely resembles a mechanical sea serpent, so keep an eye out for updates on that firm as well.\n\nFollow me via LinkTree, or @tinamcasey on Threads, LinkedIn, and Instagram.\n\nPhoto (cropped): US lawmakers propose a new $1 billion funding pot to stimulate launch the domestic marine energy industry into the big leagues of the renewable energy transition (courtesy of Eco Wave Power)."

            "article_text": "Today\u2019s energy landscape continues to evolve as countries around the world increase their focus on decarbonization and shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. The energy transition is driving significant investment and a variety of actions across the industry, from wind and solar energy startups to legacy oil and gas companies and the manufacturing and technology companies supporting the ecosystem.\n\nEnergy transition investment is on the rise, with $303 billion invested in the U.S. in 2023, according to BloombergNEF, up 22% from the prior year. Still, that is a fraction of the $1.77 trillion that was invested globally. The business case for adopting renewable energy is making more sense for companies, even with today\u2019s higher cost of capital. Renewable energy companies find themselves with increased interest in funding, new tax credits, other incentives and decreasing equipment costs. As a result, projects that previously may not have had a justifiable return on investment could now be viable and even attractive opportunities."

            "article_text": "Carbon emissions from electric generation are down 48% from 2005 levels\n\nSince 2022, helped customers access nearly $377 million in financial support\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2013 Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) today released its 2023 Impact Report, its 18th annual accounting of its progress toward its sustainable business goals. This year\u2019s report includes highlights from its 2050 clean energy transition strategy, which strives to deliver industry-leading reliability, competitive rates for customers, and accelerated infrastructure and economic development to meet the growing needs of its more than 8 million customers.\n\nExamples highlighted include the many ways in which Duke Energy offers customers options for controlling their energy use, as well as the assistance it provides to its customers in need. Over the past two years, the company has helped customers access nearly $377 million in financial support through a dedicated agency team of customer advocates. It also has made investments in its grid that has resulted in more reliable service to its customers. In 2023, smart, self-healing grid technologies helped Duke Energy\u2019s customers avoid more than 1.5 million power outages, saving approximately 3.5 million hours of total outage time.\n\nIn pursuing its clean energy transition strategy, Duke Energy works alongside its stakeholders as it drives toward delivering a cleaner, more diverse mix of energy sources while accounting for the significant engineering, environmental and social considerations embedded in such a transformation, one of the country\u2019s largest in the utility sector.\n\n\u201cAs the company executes its clean energy transition, it is assembling a sophisticated puzzle,\u201d said Katherine Neebe, Duke Energy\u2019s chief sustainability officer. \u201cEach piece \u2013 energy generation and storage, grid modernization, supporting communities and working with various stakeholders, multiskilling employees and reducing carbon emissions \u2013 is essential. It\u2019s about finding the perfect fit for each piece to create a final picture that reveals a landscape of sustainable and interconnected solutions.\u201d\n\nOther report highlights and insights include:\n\nDuke Energy continues to decarbonize to meet its climate goals. The company\u2019s carbon emissions from electric generation are down 48% since 2005 and it is on track to meet its interim 50% carbon emission reduction target by 2030. The path to net-zero is not linear. Duke Energy anticipates some fluctuations in its carbon emissions in the short term as coal is retired and other forms of generation are brought online.\n\n\n\nThe company is leading the industry with net-zero goals that address 95% of the company\u2019s Scope 1, 2 and certain Scope 3 calculated greenhouse gas footprint.\n\n\n\nThe company continues to decarbonize its natural gas business unit with a focus on methane detection and reduction of emissions related to the gas it purchases as well as the downstream carbon emissions related to its customers\u2019 consumption of the gas it sells. Duke Energy is also investing in renewable natural gas as an important tool to tackle greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nDuke Energy advocates for policies that reduce the customer rate impacts of investments in clean energy infrastructure as well as support the energy transition, such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and federal energy tax credits like those included in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\n\nDuke Energy submitted 15 IIJA-funded applications to reduce the cost of developing and deploying clean energy technologies and grid improvements in an effort to maintain customer affordability.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s economic development team, working with state and local authorities, helped attract 15,000 new jobs and $22 billion in capital investment.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental justice is critical to engaging communities in the clean energy transition and the company is evolving this work by putting its principles in action. In addition, the team completed over 100 initial environmental justice assessments as part of a holistic approach to project development and execution as well as the development of statewide and regional environmental justice advisory councils across North Carolina.\n\n\n\nAs the energy sector transitions, the company is working to ensure its workforce and others in the industry are set up for long-term success. As part of this commitment, a team worked collaboratively with various groups to develop a first-of-its-kind just transition approach resource as a guide for successful engagement. Transparency and communication will help the company achieve the most equitable solutions. In 2023, the company and its Foundation provided $120,000 in employee-led giving to benefit coal plant communities.\n\n\n\nInclusive actions drive business outcomes to create a workplace where everyone thrives. To deliver reliable products and services that meet community needs, the company depends on a skilled and diverse workforce and continually evolves its hiring practices to attract qualified professionals.\n\nHow the company mitigates the risks associated with its business, while at the same time creating value for its employees, customers and communities, is foundational to creating lasting impact. It takes time to work through all of the complexities of the clean energy transition, and the company is focused on these opportunities every day.\n\nDuke Energy\n\nDuke Energy (NYSE: DUK), a Fortune 150 company headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., is one of America\u2019s largest energy holding companies.\n\nThe company\u2019s electric utilities serve 8.4 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, and collectively own approximately 54,800 megawatts of energy capacity. Its natural gas utilities serve 1.7 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky.\n\nDuke Energy is executing an ambitious clean energy transition, keeping reliability, affordability and accessibility at the forefront as the company works toward net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas business by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050. The company is investing in major electric grid upgrades and cleaner generation, including expanded energy storage, renewables, natural gas and nuclear.\n\nMore information is available at duke-energy.com and the Duke Energy News Center.

            "search_summary": "Citi achieves $441B of its $1 trillion sustainable finance 2030 goal: report\u00a0\u00a0ESG Dive",
            "article_text": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nCitigroup has financed and facilitated $441.2 billion toward sustainable finance four years into a goal to invest $1 trillion in the sector by 2030, the bank said in its 2023 ESG Report Monday.\n\nfour years into a goal to invest $1 trillion in the sector Citi also has reached or surpassed targets for five of eight goals to decrease its operational footprint by 2025, against a 2010 baseline, including goals on reducing location-based greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy sourcing, water consumption and waste reduction.\n\nThe financial group said its investment banking sector accounts for the largest portion of its sustainable investments \u2014 85% \u2014 and renewable energy-related activities were a \u201cmajor driver\u201d of the bank\u2019s progress in 2023. Citi said part of this was due to clients who were spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act and its $369 billion in clean energy tax credits.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCiti said it remains on track to reach its 2030 sustainable finance goals, which it called \u201can integrated effort\u201d across its operations. The bank invested $92.7 billion in green infrastructure, climate tech and social initiatives in 2023 to work toward this goal. For activities to qualify, they must meet at least one of the company\u2019s established ESG criteria.\n\nSustainable finance activities that touched environmental issues accounted for 64% of that spending, or $59.3 billion, while social activities accounted for 16% or $14.7 billion. Twenty percent of the 2023 financing touched both environmental and social issues, accounting for $18.7 billion in spending. Citi said in the report it is consistently being presented with activities that meet \u201cmultiple sustainability criteria and [result] in both environmental and social impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a time of unprecedented pressure and opportunity to address rising environmental and social challenges, sustainable finance remains a critical tool for supporting action on these issues,\u201d Citi said in the report. \u201cInvestors, companies and governments alike recognize the role the financial services sector can play in mobilizing capital and advising clients to support their transition to a more sustainable, inclusive and low-carbon economy.\u201d\n\nRenewable energy accounted for the largest single-issue sustainable finance criteria in 2023, as the bank invested $14 billion in renewable energy-related activities; nearly the same amount spent on all solely social issues. Affordable housing represented the bank\u2019s largest issue area on social issue financing, and Citi said it invested $7.1 billion in affordable housing-related activities last year. Included in that tally is $6.5 billion in direct financing for affordable housing projects in the U.S.\n\nThe bank said that while renewable energy continues to pace its investment growth, it also saw growth in its thematic bonds \u2014 green, social or sustainable bonds \u2014 and its services business. The bank\u2019s services sector particularly saw growth in its export agency and sustainable supply chain financing services, according to the report. However, Citi said it saw a decline in sustainability-linked mergers and acquisitions last year.\n\nOn its 2025 operational targets, the bank said it has reduced its location-based GHG emissions 49%, compared to a 45% goal; sourced 100% renewable energy, which it has done every year since 2020; reduced its waste by more than half and its water consumption by one-third; and more than 40% of its buildings have a sustainable building certification, compared to 2010 baselines.\n\nCiti, a member of the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance, still has three 2025 goals that have yet to be achieved. The bank\u2019s operations have reduced energy consumption 35%, compared to a 40% goal; it got 9% of its water from reclaimed or reused sources in 2023, compared to a 25% goal; and diverted 30% of its waste from landfills, with a goal to divert half of its waste from landfills by 2025.\n\nThe bank also surpassed its $1 billion financing goal for its Action for Racial Equity program, according to the report. The goal was set in 2020, after the unrest following George Floyd\u2019s murder, and the program was officially allowed to proceed unabated after the Department of Labor issued an advisory opinion in October.\n\nCiti also agreed to disclose its clean energy financing ratios last month, prompted by a shareholder resolution filed by the New York City Comptroller\u2019s Office, the New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement System and Teachers\u2019 Retirement System in January. The bank announced it would disclose its financing ratio of low-carbon energy supply to fossil fuel energy supply shortly after JPMorgan Chase unveiled its decision to do so.\n\nThe bank\u2019s latest ESG report comes a month after its 2023 Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures report, which found that 71% of the bank\u2019s energy sector clients lack a substantive transition plan that accounts for all scoped emissions, or have one in place with an \u201cunclear ability to execute on it.\u201d"
