            "article_text": "Canadian investors and corporations are sticking with the principles of environmental, social and governance investing in the face of an intensifying backlash in the United States, but they are being far less vocal about it.\n\nA survey of ESG sentiment released Wednesday shows major investors remain committed to targets for reducing carbon emissions, diversity in the workplace and other sustainability-related measures as parts of their risk-management programs. ESG as a marketing strategy is falling by the wayside, however.\n\nIn its survey of 27 Canadian institutional investors representing $4.3-trillion in assets under management, Montreal-based consultancy Millani found that 93 per cent integrate ESG into their investment decisions, even after U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House promising to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and many emission disclosure regulations.\n\nA lingering question in Canadian investment circles is whether Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda will spill over the border. Milla Craig, Millani\u2019s chief executive officer, said investors are cognizant of the anti-ESG and anti-DEI forces dominating headlines, especially in the U.S., but see those metrics as critical to risk-adjusted returns.\n\n\u201cMaybe it comes down to the roots of ESG. It\u2019s not about divestment, it\u2019s not about negative screening. It\u2019s really about strong analysis,\u201d Ms. Craig said.\n\n\u201cProfessional managers will be looking at this scenario that we are living right now, asking themselves questions about the impacts of tariffs, changes to policies on climate or diversity and inclusion. How are the companies reacting? Are they changing their strategies? Are they changing their policies?\u201d she said.\n\nThe ESG backlash has gathered steam in the U.S. over the past two years, with Republican-led jurisdictions such as Texas and Florida banning the use of the principles in state business, saying they are an attack on the fossil-fuel industry. Shareholder activists, meanwhile, have pressed some major companies such as Walmart Inc. WMT-N, Deere & Co. DE-N and Molson Coors Beverage Co. TPX-B-T into dropping their DEI programs.\n\nWith Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election, such moves have quickly become federal policy, with DEI barred from government departments and agencies from the Pentagon to the CIA.\n\nIn the past month, Canada\u2019s big banks have all withdrawn from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a global organization of financial institutions formed to direct capital to achieving emission-reduction targets, for fear of antitrust and other business risks in the United States. As they have cut ties with the NZBA, the lenders have said they still intend to meet decarbonization goals and help their clients do so as well.\n\nSince Mr. Trump first threatened Canada with 25-per-cent tariffs, agreed to a 30-day deferment of those tariffs, then slapped them on steel and aluminum anyway, anti-American sentiment has spread. That could lead some Canadian companies to double down on ESG programs, said Yrjo Koskinen, a professor of sustainable and transition finance at the University of Calgary\u2019s Haskayne School of Business.\n\nHe is scheduled to discuss the ESG backlash along with Ms. Craig and Rachel Curley, the director of policy for US SIF: The Sustainable Investment Forum, at a CFA Montreal event Wednesday.\n\n\u201cMaybe the U.S. will have a significantly less cultural influence over Canada \u2013 where everything coming from the U.S. is deemed undesirable. We\u2019ll see,\u201d Prof. Koskinen said. He noted that a Conservative victory in a coming federal election could prompt less focus on ESG and sustainable finance at the federal level, but any pushback would take a milder form than what\u2019s happening in the U.S.\n\nCostco Wholesale Corp. COST-Q resisted pressure to drop its DEI policies and won support from forces on the political left and derision from their right-wing opponents, he said. But some companies are preferring to keep their sustainability programs quiet, to avoid drawing attention to them, and away from their efforts to improve their bottom lines, a practice known as green-hushing.\n\nThe political shift does not mean environmental risks have subsided, however, Prof. Koskinen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had the warmest year on record in 2024, wildfires in California, hurricanes on the East Coast. It\u2019s impossible or very expensive to get house insurance now in California and Florida. Those risks are all over the place, and they don\u2019t disappear.\u201d\n\nThe Millani survey also found institutional managers largely believe Canada\u2019s climate and sustainability disclosure should be in line with international standards and the recently published recommendations of the Canadian Sustainability Standards Board, even with the U.S. expected to soften or eliminate some of its established rules."

            "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: Lawyer Radha Curpen, the Vancouver-based Group Head of ESG and Sustainability, at law firm McMillan LLP, in Vancouver, on Sept. 20.Jennifer Gauthier/The Globe and Mail\n\nCanada, meet Robby Starbuck.\n\nThe online activist takes credit for pressure campaigns that have prompted multiple U.S. companies to scale back or eliminate their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies and practices. Companies such as Deere & Co., Harley-Davidson Inc., Molson Coors Beverage Co. and Walmart Inc., have all said they\u2019ll change hiring practices, pull out of relationships with equity groups or cut funding for pride parades.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now changed policy at companies worth over US$2-trillion, with many millions of employees who have better workplace environments as a result,\u201d Mr. Starbuck posted Nov. 25 on X, after he said his meeting with Walmart executives prompted a host of changes, including their decision not to extend a five-year, US$100-million philanthropic commitment to fighting systemic racism the retailer made in 2020.\n\n\u201cCompanies can clearly see that America wants normalcy back. The era of wokeness is dying right in front of our eyes. The landscape of corporate America is quickly shifting to sanity and neutrality. We are now the trend, not the anomaly.\u201d\n\nThe Globe and Mail revises 2024 Board Games marking criteria\n\nCanadians might be tempted to dismiss Mr. Starbuck as an anomaly, a product of U.S. culture wars. But he\u2019s one of the most visible faces of a full-scale war on environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies and their subset of DEI practices.\n\nLegislators in Republican-led U.S. states have been fighting ESG investment practices through a series of attacks on their own state treasuries and pension funds. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling killing affirmative action admissions in colleges has prompted lawsuits against private-sector employers for their hiring practices. And with the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, the federal government seems unlikely to stand in the way of any of these assaults.\n\nCanadian companies will find no respite by simply being on the other side of the border. At a minimum, those with U.S. operations must navigate the new American climate.\n\nTo avoid losing business to anti-ESG policies, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal, for example, have had to assure governments in Texas and West Virginia that they do not eschew lending to fossil fuel companies. In the case of BMO, it reversed a previously stated policy that restricted lending to new clients that operate significant coal mines or coal-fired power generation in favour of what it calls a \u201ccomprehensive, risk-based approach.\u201d\n\nThe Globe and Mail\u2019s comprehensive ranking of Canada\u2019s corporate boards for 2024\n\nWalmart\u2019s DEI rollback signals a profound shift in the wake of Trump\u2019s election victory\n\nCan it happen here? It\u2019s easy to say Canada is a far different society, with a far different business culture. But the signs of some tumult are already here, with the population outside Canada\u2019s urban centres restive. Alberta\u2019s ruling United Conservative Party is openly hostile to DEI and climate initiatives, and federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, Canada\u2019s likely prime-minister-in-waiting, repeatedly uses the word \u201cwoke\u201d as a pejorative while promising to undo the signature piece of climate policy produced by the current Liberal government.\n\nIn short, Canadian companies will likely find they need to obscure their ESG and DEI practices with new names, to avoid what have become damaged brands.\n\nBut so far, the results in The Globe and Mail\u2019s Board Games corporate ranking, done in partnership with Toronto consulting firm Global Governance Advisors, do not show a pullback in these policies in 2024 disclosures.\n\nCanadian sustainability board close to issuing first climate-disclosure rules\n\nBoard Games introduced climate disclosure questions in 2023 and expanded them in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, when climate criteria were worth four points of a total score of 100, 13 companies \u2013 or 6 per cent of 219 measured \u2013 received a full score. There were 76 companies that received zero points.\n\nIn 2024, with climate criteria worth nine points, there were 21 companies, about 10 per cent of 215 measured, that received a full score. At the other extreme, however, just 15 companies received zero points.\n\nBoard Games has also ratcheted up its diversity criteria. After long counting the proportion of women on corporate boards, Board Games added criteria for other types of diversity in 2020.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, Board Games devoted 13 points to diversity. In 2023, 19 companies received a full score, and only one company received zero points. There were 53 companies that failed to get at least seven of the 13 points. In 2024, by comparison, 35 received the full 13 points, while none received zero and just 30 failed to get at least seven of the 13 points.\n\n\u201cIn two years we saw probably the most significant change in years in women getting on S&P/TSX Composite Index boards,\u201d said Tony Spizzirri, the partner at Global Governance Advisors who oversees the firm\u2019s Board Games work. Women represent at least one-third of board seats at 79 per cent of companies in the 2024 Board Games on the TSX Index. In 2022, it was at least a third at just 53 per cent of companies. \u201dIt seems many of these companies were also improving diversity in other ways during this time,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn Valley, a partner at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP who co-ordinates the law firm\u2019s extensive annual report on diversity at the Canadian corporate board level, said his firm hasn\u2019t seen a pullback in disclosures or diversity practices in proxy circulars by Canadian companies. \u201cWhether that will change is an open question.\u201d\n\nIn Canada, companies and their investors have so far not faced a high level of opposition to ESG, but their use of the acronym is quickly falling out of favour.\n\nA recent survey of corporate disclosure by Montreal-based consultancy Millani charted steady growth for many years in mentions of ESG by companies in the composite index. Last year, the trend reversed, with just 29 per cent of listed companies referring to ESG, down from 40 per cent the year before. Fifty-three per cent of corporations, meanwhile, used \u201csustainability\u201d instead.\n\nThis stands in stark contrast to the market mania of the early 2020s, when ESG was sold by the investment industry as an asset class unto itself.\n\nMelanie Adams, managing director and global head of responsible investment for RBC Global Asset Management, said \u201cit was almost unfortunate how far the pendulum swung\u201d with attention to ESG because it obscured that the factors underlying it have always been critical for investors. \u201cBecause now it has swung back the other way with the ESG backlash.\u201d\n\nThe picture has been muddied further by Ottawa\u2019s newly enacted anti-greenwashing legislation, which puts companies in legal jeopardy for issuing disclosures that do not live up to scientific scrutiny, said Milla Craig, chief executive officer of Millani.\n\nYet most companies still consider these factors to be key fiduciary duties for their managers and directors. Torys LLP reports that 95 per cent of the companies in the composite index publish some form of ESG, climate action or transition report, and nearly four-fifths include ESG, climate, environmental or sustainability within their board skills matrix. Further, 59 per cent tie executive pay to climate-related targets or metrics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think companies are changing their approach to how they prudently and responsibly manage and oversee risks,\u201d said lawyer Rima Ramchandani, co-head of Torys\u2019 capital markets practice. \u201cBecause of the politicization, some companies are choosing to be more cautious about what they say.\u201d\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Radha Curpen says the political left sees ESG as a vehicle for social outcomes, while the right thinks it fails to maximize shareholder value and means divesting fossil fuels.Jennifer Gauthier/The Globe and Mail\n\nRadha Curpen, the Vancouver-based Group Head of ESG and Sustainability at law firm McMillan LLP, said the political left sees ESG as a vehicle for social outcomes, while the right thinks it fails to maximize shareholder value and means divesting fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of that,\u201d she argues. \u201cESG represents the risks and opportunities that we face today. That\u2019s what it is. The key is governance. How are we going to govern with the changing world? \u2026 We need everything in our tool box to deal with it. We don\u2019t have to call it ESG. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nThe next step will come as Canada decides what to require of public companies for disclosure. The Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB) will soon publish its first set of sustainability and climate-related reporting guidelines. The guidelines will initially be voluntary, but the standards are expected to form the foundation of required disclosure.\n\nThe Canadian Securities Administrators, the umbrella group for the country\u2019s provincial and territorial securities commissions, has said it will study the CSSB standards before issuing rules on what companies will have to disclose. But the CSA has not committed to adopting those standards as is. When the CSA made an initial run at climate disclosure rules, prior to the CSSB\u2019s work, its proposed standards were not as comprehensive or rigorous.\n\nPublic comment on the CSSB standards showed support from institutional investors, but significant pushback from the energy industry, which generally called for less reporting and longer deadlines. Advocates for the CSSB standards fear the CSA will listen to the latter, not the former.\n\n\u201cIt would be unfortunate for the CSA to try to second-guess that process after so many years in the making and say, \u2018Okay, now let\u2019s try and think that through again and see if we can come up with some different compromise,\u2019\u201d said Kevin Thomas, chief executive officer of the Shareholder Association for Research & Education, known as SHARE. The group, which works on behalf of investors, is among the most active pushing for stronger ESG policies.\n\nCSA spokesperson Ilana Kelemen declined to comment until the CSSB standards are issued.\n\nAs regulations and requirements evolve gradually, investors are often taking ESG matters into their own hands. Some, said Dexter John, chief executive officer of Sodali & Co.\u2019s Canadian office, are adopting investment criteria that are more stringent than what proxy advisers such as Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass, Lewis & Co. recommend.\n\nAccording to Sodali & Co., ESG was the focus of 74 Canadian shareholder proposals in the most recent proxy season, up from 50 in 2023. There were just a handful of anti-ESG proposals, largely filed by a small activist group called InvestNow, and they did poorly, with roughly 1 per cent of votes in favour.\n\nIn contrast to climate pressures, DEI initiatives are in their earliest days as a subject of shareholder proposals.\n\nInvestors have pressed companies, including some of Canada\u2019s big banks, to conduct what are called racial equity audits \u2013 examinations of whether policies and procedures support diversity and equity. Toronto-Dominion Bank became the first to release an audit. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, RBC and BMO have all agreed to them, but the latter two banks narrowly defeated shareholder proposals in 2023 calling for them.\n\nFuture shareholder efforts, however, will occur against a backdrop of increasing hostility to DEI in the United States \u2013 and, possibly, Canada.\n\nWhile Mr. Starbuck\u2019s methods garner him attention, much of the anti-DEI work in the U.S. occurred in response to the expansion of the Black Lives Matter that was driven by the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis, Minn.\n\nAcademic think tanks developed campaigns to create ESG and DEI backlash among the public, broadly, and legislators in conservative states, specifically. (One think tank has called BLM funding \u201ca form of reparations made to self-declared enemies of the American nation and way of life.\u201d) After a U.S. Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action at universities, lawsuits against private-sector entities followed.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump was first elected in 2016, disparaging language for anything labelled liberal, progressive or \u201cwoke\u201d became more acceptable, said Dustyn Lanz, chief executive officer of Toronto ESG proxy voting data firm OxProx. He does not think Canada will completely replicate that journey, but he sees similar signs.\n\nMr. Lanz noted that Mr. Poilievre has been deriding progressive ideas as woke. After a riot occurred during an anti-NATO protest in Montreal on Nov. 22, Mr. Poilievre tweeted a response to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying, \u201cThis is what happens when a Prime Minister spends 9 years pushing toxic woke identity politics, dividing and subdividing people by race, gender, vaccine status, religion, region, age, wealth, etc.\u201d\n\nAt the Alberta United Conservatives\u2019 recent annual meeting, Mr. Lanz noted, members booed when someone tried to explain unconscious bias, a core tenet of DEI programs. That showed UCP members \u201cfeel totally comfortable deriding someone in public\u201d for supporting DEI \u2013 and signals Canada is shifting, as well.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Canadian securities regulators are also wrestling with proposals on mandated board-diversity disclosure for public companies. The CSA has put out two competing proposals, which became known as the \u201cOntario\u201d and \u201cWestern\u201d models. The Ontario model, backed by the Ontario Securities Commission, is more prescriptive and lists the diverse groups companies must include in their disclosure. The Western model, backed by Alberta and Saskatchewan, is more narrative and allows companies more freedom to define diversity as they see fit.\n\nThe comment period for the two models ended 14 months ago, and there has been no decision since.\n\nOSC spokesperson Debra Chan said the commission \u201cis working with our CSA colleagues to find a harmonized path forward that meets the needs of our markets. This work is complex and remains a priority.\u201d The CSA\u2019s Ms. Kelemen sent essentially the same statement as the OSC did.\n\nWes Hall, the founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Kingsdale Advisors and the founder of the BlackNorth Initiative, a group that seeks corporate pledges to improve diversity, said if the OSC waits for a CSA decision, \u201cIt will never happen, it just will never. So, in my view, this should be something that\u2019s led by the OSC, and everybody else follow them.\u201d\n\nMr. Hall acknowledges he is concerned about corporate Canada\u2019s commitment to BlackNorth going forward, given the influence the U.S. has on Canadian companies. But, he said, no prominent companies have backed out. \u201cBecause they\u2019re rolling everything back in the States, we should just roll it back here in Canada, too? Why can\u2019t we be the leaders and say no, no, no, that\u2019s not what we stand for in this country?\u201d\n\nIan Robertson, partner with the executive consulting firm Jefferson Hawthorne Group, plans to make advising his clients on the rise of the anti-woke movement in Canada a key part of his business.\n\nMany companies put DEI policies in place reactively, not strategically, he said. Now that they\u2019re under the opposite kind of political pressure, they cannot justify keeping the policies based on a return on investment, said Mr. Robertson, who was formerly chief executive officer of Kingsdale.\n\nOutside of \u201cthe business-hub bubbles of Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver,\u201d Mr. Robertson said, views on a lot of issues in the rest of Canada are very different from the pro-ESG and pro-DEI consensus.\n\n\u201cI would say thinking that we\u2019re not American is not a strategy.\u201d\n\nBoard Games, by the numbers\n\nWomen on boards\n\nWomen represent at least one-third of board seats at 79 per cent of companies in the 2024 Board Games on the TSX Index. In 2022, that was true at just 53 per cent of companies.\n\nBoard diversity\n\nSeventy-three per cent of the Board Games companies explicitly disclose they have at least one board member from a diverse group other than women. Of that, 32 per cent have one board member from a diverse group and 41 per cent have more than one.\n\nClimate expertise\n\nIn 2024, 52 per cent of companies disclosed that climate expertise is a \u201crequired skill\u201d in the board skills matrix and at least one director has that climate expertise. In 2023, that percentage was just 18 per cent.\n\nPerformance pay\n\nPerformance share units (PSUs) make up at least half of the CEO\u2019s long-term incentive grant value at 77 per cent of companies, while 12 per cent of companies do not use PSUs in compensation.\n\nESG in pay\n\nOne-third of the Board Games companies disclose and use quantifiable climate-related metrics in awarding or setting either short-term or long-term incentive-pay plans. Another 44 per cent use some sort of environmental, social or governance metric that isn\u2019t climate-related. Only 23 per cent of companies do not use any at all.\n\nAnnual meetings\n\nOnly 23 per cent of Board Games companies hold a \u201chybrid\u201d annual meeting that allows shareholders to attend either online or in person. The remaining 77 per cent hold a virtual meeting, or an in-person meeting, but not both.\n\nSay on pay\n\nSixty-three per cent of Board Games companies received at least 90-per-cent support from shareholders on their 2023 say on pay non-binding advisory executive compensation resolutions, while 16 per cent fell below that threshold, and 21 per cent did not hold a say on pay vote.\n\nSource: Global Governance Advisors\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this article incorrectly described OxProx as a governance advisory firm.
