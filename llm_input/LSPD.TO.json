            "article_text": "Published 03-16-22 Submitted by FigBytes\n\nOTTAWA, Ontario, March 16, 2022 /CSRwire/ - FigBytes recently announced their environmental, social, governance (ESG) platform has been recognized among the top 14 providers in The Forrester New Wave\u2122: Sustainability Management Software, Q1 2022. The report is an evaluation of the most significant vendors in the emerging market.\n\nTo be considered each vendor needed to have:\n\na purpose-built sustainability management product or service\n\nmarket experience with 10 percent of customers residing outside of the organization\u2019s home region\n\nat least $5 million in funding.\n\n\u201c[FigBytes] is the best fit for companies that need coverage across ESG factors,\u201d the report states. \u201c[They\u2019re] a good choice for organizations looking for full ESG program management, reporting, and strategy.\u201d\n\nThe Forrester report also states that FigBytes offers \u201cstrong reporting capabilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cReporting is one of the most important aspects of ESG,\u201d said FigBytes CEO and founder, Ted Dhillon. \u201cWithout insightful reporting, companies can\u2019t gauge progress towards their sustainability goals like net-zero. These initiatives are often complicated. That\u2019s why we enable transparency with advanced analytics that power simple, preconfigured dashboards to support ESG performance monitoring.\u201d\n\nWhile there are several carbon accounting tools available, FigBytes capitalized on a gap in the market \u2013 the robust take. Using their platform, customers can go beyond calculating carbon emissions (though to date they\u2019ve tracked 2.5 billion metric tons) and look at everything from water to supplier transparency to diversity among employees. With this data in hand companies can start setting and meeting their sustainability goals sooner.\n\nAs more companies make commitments to climate action plans the risk of greenwashing rises too. Stakeholders need to be able to tell the difference between the goal-setters and the goal-achievers. The comprehensive platform with real-time and engaging reports that FigBytes offers is proven to be a real differentiator in the field.\n\n\u201cWe are so honoured to be recognized by Forrester as a company that is, in our opinion, making headway in this landscape. FigBytes is excited to continue working with our clients to make effective change for the planet,\u201d concluded Dhillon.\n\nAbout FigBytes Established in 2014, FigBytes helps companies and governments plan, track and fulfill goals along their environmental, social, governance (ESG) journey. Their platform helps integrate strategy, align data, and report on progress while engaging stakeholders.

            "article_text": "Over the past few years, the ESG movement gained a broad following across corporate America, with a proliferation of related management and investment strategies to advance ESG priorities.\n\nBut in the past year, the ESG movement risked stalling, amid scrutiny revealing the insincerity of managerial proponents and a declining level of both returns and enthusiasm among funds and individuals alike.\n\nWhat accounts for the rise and stall of ESG and what might we expect in the next three years?\n\nSince launching the ESG movement in 2004, the United Nations (UN) promoted incontestable aspirations such as to end poverty, hunger and war and to promote sustainable living \u2014 defined as using only those resources that are necessary to meet current needs and thereby preserve resources to meet the needs of future generations.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe UN articulated related management and investment principles that came to coalesce around equally virtuous ideas in three categories: environmental, spanning from mitigating climate change to fighting water scarcity; social, encompassing customer satisfaction and assuring fair labor standards; and governance, assuring board leadership to advance such goals.\n\nThe UN persuaded many managers and investors to follow, especially in Europe but also in the United States. For instance, companies began to create more ecological production and packaging methods, improved employee training and workplace safety, and appointed sustainability officers.\n\nAmong investors, many incorporated a company's ESG commitments into traditional investment analysis, believing that would improve returns; others prioritize social impact as much as financial returns; and some exclude certain businesses they simply regard as un-ESG, such as those involved with alcohol, gambling, guns, oil or tobacco.\n\nOver the next decade, ESG's appeal gradually widened in the United States into a movement due to several factors. For one, the concept of sustainability and the UN's other virtuous concepts are inherently appealing. The movement was amplified by massive index funds that found ESG a good way to compete in a market where it's not possible to compete on price or returns.\n\nFrom 2019, the ESG movement intensified in the United States due to other powerful social movements such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, whose participants seek remedies for grievances of the sort ESG seemed to offer. This intensification was reinforced by an eroding trust in American government (worsened by the pandemic) that led Americans to look to the private sector for solutions to economic and social problems.\n\nAs such forces gathered strength from Europe to America, they enticed development of a cottage industry in ESG that grew so vast to become a self-sustaining power, commonly called the \u201cESG ecosystem.\u201d Millions earn their living through ESG, from framework developers, standard-setters and dozens of big data providers to broad coalitions, professional service firms, money managers and an army of nongovernmental organizations.\n\nDuring the COVID pandemic, investment dollars began to be allocated to companies ranking high for ESG consciousness, starting in the first quarter of 2020. Investment inflows to ESG funds were greatest among European investors but included a large segment in the United States. Those in the ESG ecosystem responded to the demand by increasingly stating specific expectations and priorities, and many investors and companies alike followed suit.\n\nInterest in ESG investing closely followed the arc of the pandemic: net investment inflows to ESG funds peaked in the first quarter of 2021, flattened throughout 2021 and declined sharply from the first quarter of 2022, according to Morningstar data. An inflection point occurred in the first quarter of 2023, with a net investment outflow from ESG funds. Net outflows continued in subsequent quarters.\n\nSurvey evidence confirms what the net investment outflows reflect: most individual investors have always prioritized financial returns over environmental benefits. That preference has been consistently held by older investors. Among younger investors, who once leaned toward ESG investing, their enthusiasm has \u201cfallen precipitously,\u201d according to a late 2023 survey by researchers at Stanford University.\n\nThe reversal of funds flows and attitudes coincides with rising concern that the ESG movement has begun to follow rigid uniform messaging with mandated behaviors, some with ideological tones. Many frictions have appeared: between those who favor spontaneous coordination through markets over mandates; between sides in a revival of long-simmering debates over corporate purpose \u2014 shareholder primacy versus stakeholder theory; and between critics and defenders of capitalism.\n\nSeveral factors deepened these frictions. Academic literature increasingly questions the promised value of ESG investing or managing. For instance, a 2022 meta review of all the studies \u2014 1,400 of them \u2014 found that \u201cthe financial performance of ESG investing has on average been indistinguishable from conventional investing.\u201d\n\nComplaints arose that asset managers in corporate balloting vote their personal interests rather than client interests. Reforms seek to pass through the vote to the ultimate investor rather than continuing to have asset managers decide.\n\nThe pi\u00c3\u00a8ce de r\u00e9sistance: the exposure of greenwashing or pinkwashing, vaguely defined colloquial terms referring to allegations of false or fraudulent assertions of ESG fidelity. That has created regulatory, litigation and reputational risk for global banks, major companies and large asset managers for claims about sustainability practices, hypocrisy and misstatements.\n\nWith the gap widening between ESG's original aspirational virtues and recent practical realities, a political divide emerged. Dozens of Republican-led states are regulating against using ESG in investment and management while Democrat-led states do the opposite. At the federal level, both the Department of Labor and the SEC took sharply different approaches from the Trump administration and that of President Biden.\n\nOn the front lines \u2014 in shareholder proposals during proxy season \u2014 record levels of progressive social proposals were put on the ballots in 2022 and 2023. Many of these addressed topics well beyond anything the UN had dreamt of, from demands that companies perform internal audits of civil rights and racial equity to demands that they discuss how they protect employee access to abortion services. Support for such proposals fell dramatically. At the same time, there have been a rising number of conservative proposals \u2014 also garnering little support. Shareholders may be saying \u201cenough\u201d to the politicization of business.\n\nRevealing further fissures are the proliferation of divergent ESG standards. Multiple authorities promulgate disclosure and directives on a bewildering array of topics using different methods and measures. Diverse regulations have been published by governments in Brazil, California, Europe, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom while attempted harmonizations have been both strenuous and of limited effect, including decades-long efforts by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and more recent ones on a broader array of topics from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.\n\nAs ESG proliferated in reach and variety, more counterpoints and criticisms readily appeared, revealing deepening trade-offs and conflicts between different ESG goals and constituents, the potential for unintended consequences and negative externalities of ESG interventions, and the ethical and moral dilemmas of ESG decision-making and evaluation. Proponents have been compelled to devote increasing time and attention to a whole new set of challenges, diminishing resources available for advocacy or proselytization.\n\nWhere to from here? The ESG movement remains forceful but faces strong headwinds that continued oversteps will intensify. That would not only stall forward momentum but reverse past achievements. Opponents must likewise remain measured in their critiques, lest they damage their credibility. They would do well to keep up the pressure, harness the tailwinds and fight to a draw.\n\nOver the coming year, the political pendulum will be back in play, amid the Presidential campaign and election. In an ideal political environment, candidates would reduce the heat as well, pulling constituents to the center. There is certainly plenty of common ground across corporate America and everyone would benefit if it could find national leadership that searched for it. Few may bet on that sanguine equilibrium, however, leaving ESG a well-intended battleground backfire."

            "article_text": "The 2022 proxy season had one of the highest records for majority-supported environmental, social, and governance (ESG) shareholder proposals in recent years, according to PWC.\n\nBut as the 2023 proxy season commences, companies are acting on \u2013 and implementing \u2013 less than two out of every five of those shareholder proposals, according to their proponents.\n\nMajority-supported shareholder proposals are rare, representing less than 10% of the 900-plus ESG proposals[1] filed last year, but as they start to grow, company responsiveness to their shareholders is being put to the test.\n\nThis creates a dynamic where investors can evaluate how well corporate boards are looking out for their interests.\n\nThe investors we surveyed believe that companies are only fully implementing 23% of proposals, and that 14% will only be partly implemented. In approximately a quarter of cases the investor proponent believes the proposal will not be addressed at all.\n\nFrom the perspective of companies, only half said they have implemented or will be implementing the proposals their shareholders passed, in part or in full. Around 6% would be addressed ahead of, or during, the next proxy voting season.\n\nFor 20 proposals (more than one-quarter of those analysed), we found that neither the company nor the proponent indicated that the company has, or would be, implementing them, with no publicly available information showing otherwise at the time of publication.\n\nThis article looks at why corporate board responsiveness to shareholder proposals that receive significant support matters, and how investors can emphasise their expectations for board accountability on ESG issues to investees as the 2023 proxy voting season approaches.\n\nBreaking down the numbers\n\nWe analysed 78[2] majority-supported shareholder proposals from the 2022 proxy season that focused on ESG issues or improving shareholder rights more broadly. To understand what has become of these proposals since the annual general meetings (AGMs) they were filed at, we issued surveys to the 26 shareholder proponents that filed them and the 70 receiving companies. The surveys were conducted between November and December 2022. We received responses from the 24 proponents of 76 resolutions (representing 97% of the resolutions in the sample), as well as from 45 companies that received 52 resolutions (67% of the total resolutions). The underlying data can be downloaded and found below.\n\nWhy does corporate board responsiveness matter?\n\nRegardless of whether an investor voted for, or agrees with, a proposal that received majority-support, company attention to them is a sign of good shareholder relations and governance.\n\nConversely, if companies frequently ignore the will of their shareholders, it can weaken the voice of investors overall and dilute the efficacy of proxy voting and shareholder proposals as important investor engagement tools.\n\nThis is particularly the case for investors seeking to mitigate systemic sustainability issues. Without corporate boards that are responsive to shareholder concerns, achieving meaningful progress on these issues via shareholder engagement is unlikely.\n\nIn jurisdictions such as the United States, where the bulk of the majority-supported ESG proposals in 2022 were filed, these resolutions are not legally binding. Nevertheless, inaction should raise red flags for investors. Voting during AGMs is an important mechanism for a company\u2019s shareholders to express their views to corporate boards and management teams.\n\nAdditionally, many institutional investors recognise proxy voting as a part of their fiduciary duty to clients and beneficiaries because it can be used to influence corporate behaviour, and thus, returns.\n\nAs fiduciaries, these investors undertake voting decisions with an eye to how the agenda items impact the long-term risk adjusted returns of the individual stock or their broader investment portfolio.\n\nMany in the investment value chain are starting to coalesce around the idea that 50% should not be the threshold for when boards and management teams are responsive to shareholders. For example, proxy advisor Glass Lewis, the UK Investment Association, and the International Corporate Governance Network have all signalled that they expect boards to engage with their shareholders and demonstrate some level of responsiveness when 20% or more of shareholders vote contrary to board recommendations.\n\nRegardless of the threshold, if majority-supported proposals are not seeing substantial implementation, investors cannot have faith in proxy voting as an effective tool to uphold their fiduciary duties.\n\nFurthermore, in most jurisdictions, board directors of publicly listed companies are tasked with looking out for shareholders\u2019 interests. When a substantial number of voting shares indicate they are in favour of a particular action, not taking such action can be seen as a governance failure on the part of the board.\n\nIt may also be an indicator of a captured board: when independent board members are more loyal to the company CEO or management team than to shareholders. Captured boards are more likely to govern in a way that favours management interests to the possible detriment of shareholders.\n\nFor instance, captured boards are less likely to fire underperforming CEOs, more likely to approve increases in CEOs pay (independent of performance), and are more likely to rubber-stamp investments recommended by the CEO[3] rather than acting as a critical risk manager.\n\nAs a result, companies with captured boards, especially those that do not have adequate ESG expertise among their independent directors, could be at a greater risk of failing to assist a company to transition to a low-carbon future or to mitigate its impact on systemic sustainability issues.\n\nThese failures could lead to increased compliance, legal, or operational expenses for companies in the long term.\n\nRecommendations for the 2023 proxy season\n\nThe 2023 proxy season provides an important opportunity for investors to establish their expectations for corporate action on majority-supported proposals.\n\nWe recommend that investors consider the following:\n\nDefine what constitutes issuer inaction\n\nMany proposals take more than a year to implement; but the AGM cycle gives investors specific, limited opportunities to weigh in on corporate actions and hold companies accountable.\n\nTherefore, investors need to establish how much progress they expect to see on majority-supported proposals by the next proxy season \u2013 are they satisfied with companies simply committing to take action or do they expect evidence of steps taken towards implementation?\n\nTo assure investors that a proposal will not be ignored, it is essential that companies show some meaningful progress in the first year. This is because many investors are voting at hundreds, sometimes thousands, of companies ever year, making it difficult to track year-on-year progress, even for the most sophisticated investment managers.\n\nInvestors should also be wary of disclosures that make it sound as if action has been taken where the company has not actually committed to or changed anything. For example, ISS\u2019s latest US voting guidelines indicate that some companies may disclose in their subsequent proxy materials that they have discussed a majority-supported resolution with their shareholders, while not making any commitment to act. Investors should think critically about whether such efforts, when used to delay action or commitment, are justified when over half of the company\u2019s voting shares have already weighed in favour of a proposal.\n\nInvestors with holdings that have received a recent majority vote on a shareholder proposal should review company proxy materials and other communications released near the AGM to determine whether those updates satisfy their expectations for action; then act accordingly.\n\nTake action\n\nStemming a trend of corporate inaction on majority-supported shareholder resolutions will require investors to systematically apply policies, engage with other market participants, communicate expectations to companies and hold company boards to account:\n\nCommunicate with the companies directly. When speaking with companies that received a majority-supported resolution, investors should clarify what actions they are expecting to see by the next AGM.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, investors should communicate their rationale for backing a proposal if they originally voted to support it. If an investor opts to withhold board support (see below) because of company inaction, they should remember that often, companies do not understand why they have done so. In all cases, best practice is to communicate the rationale with investee companies ahead of voting, as this increases transparency and accountability, and provides an opportunity to initiate a dialogue and receive additional information.\n\n\n\nIf communicating ahead of the AGM is not possible, communicating with the company afterwards can still be impactful.[4]\n\nHold directors accountable for failing to act on majority-supported resolutions. If an investor determines that the company\u2019s actions are inadequate, or that it hasn\u2019t demonstrated any action or commitment, efforts to hold the board accountable can be a powerful escalation strategy. Investors can do so by voting against all directors, or take a more targeted approach, such as withholding support for: the board chair or lead independent director the chair or members of the governance committee the chair or members of the committee with the closest oversight responsibilities to the proposal\u2019s request Investors could also consider proposing alternative directors (assuming the legal codes where the company is incorporated allow for this) or engaging companies on improving shareholder access to board members.\n\n\n\nThroughout 2023, we will be convening workshops and creating resources for signatories to assist them in identifying best practices for board accountability, the tools they have at their disposal, and the challenges and opportunities they face to conduct this work.\n\nIf an investor determines that the company\u2019s actions are inadequate, or that it hasn\u2019t demonstrated any action or commitment, efforts to hold the board accountable can be a powerful escalation strategy.

To keep the game moving along, antes will increase as rounds progress so the game doesn\u2019t continue in the wee hours of the night. In poker, upping the ante is about making the game more enticing for players, but when it comes to ESG \u2015 environmental, social and governance \u2015 consumer packaged goods (CPG) corporations are upping the ante to make their company and brands more sustainable and accountable to regulators, shareholders and ultimately consumers.\n\nEarlier this year, Westminster, Colo.-based TraceGrains released the \u201cState of ESG Compliance\u201d report, which highlights the disconnect between well-meaning CPGs and their ability to deliver ESG-compliant products in the context of an increasingly complex global supply chain.\n\nThe TraceGrains\u2019 report is based on responses from 343 food and beverage leaders across quality, operations, safety and R&D roles at large CPG companies in North America, the UK, EMEA, APAC, and LATAM, with 61% of survey respondents reporting revenues upwards of $25 million, it notes.\n\nThe report shows that food and beverage brands understand the importance of ESG compliance with 64% acknowledging as such. Respondents also noted that 46% prioritize doing business with ESG-compliant ingredient suppliers.\n\nIn terms of the motivating factors for ESG efforts, the report highlighted evolving regulatory landscapes (32%), consumer demand (27%), and competitive pressures (18%).\n\nAlthough food and beverage brands are eager to incorporate ESG objectives into their business practices, hurdles do remain. In fact, 41% of respondents indicated they are falling short of achieving full ESG compliance.\n\nThe report also shows that confusion resides within ESG, particularly when it comes to sustainable-associated labels. For instance, 42% respondents agree that confusion surrounding the labeling of sustainable foods is an issue.\n\n\u201cThat lack of clarity extends up the food chain to brands themselves, the ones tasked with producing ESG-compliant foods,\u201d the report states. \u201cWith no formal guidelines in place to validate ESG partners, they end up choosing partners based on informal methods like word-of-mouth conversations with other brands (23%) or simply taking a supplier\u2019s word for it (35%). Only 16% reported using software solutions to filter for ESG partners.\u201d\n\nBeyond this, the report found that the top hurdles for food and beverage companies implementing a successful ESG objective come down to the three variables: cost, visibility and technology.\n\nIn terms of cost, the report found that 67% are willing to pay more for ESG-compliant ingredients. Meanwhile, with visibility, 49% of respondents indicated wanting deeper visibility into their supply chains beyond just Tier 1 suppliers. In terms of technology, the report highlighted various technology investments as top drivers, such as ensuring supply chain transparency and traceability (55%), managing supplier and vendor standards and compliance (48%), and reducing carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions (43%).\n\nGiven all of this, it seems as though food and beverage companies are eager to incorporate ESG-compliant ingredients with 42% of respondent indicating plans to increase usage of these ingredients in the next six to 12 months.\n\nBacardi Ltd. marked its 161st anniversary by announcing it will plant one tree for every employee to support biodiversity, help local communities, and capture a combined 2.5M kg of carbon dioxide during the trees\u2019 lifetime.\n\nImage courtesy of Bacardi Ltd.\n\nTaking necessary steps\n\nWith food and beverage companies showing a growing interest in ESG-complaint ingredients to their business, many corporations are taking the steps in expansive environmental ways.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, family-owned Bacardi Ltd. marked its 161st anniversary by announcing it will plant one tree for every employee to support biodiversity, help local communities, and capture a combined 2.5M kg of carbon dioxide during the trees\u2019 lifetime.\n\nEach person in the company received an anniversary edition bottle of BACARD\u00cd Carta Blanca, complete with a QR code, which enables them to plant their own tree and then track its progress and positive impact through an online platform, the company noted. The trees are being planted in India, Nepal, Indonesia, Ecuador, and Madagascar, with 11 different species carefully selected to maximize the benefits to each location and community, it added.\n\n\u201cWe care deeply about the farmers who grow our beautiful ingredients and take great pride in the strong relationships we\u2019ve spent decades building with these communities,\u201d said Dave Ingram, chief supply chain officer at Bacardi Ltd., in a statement at the time of the announcement. \u201cPlanting these trees on their doorsteps is another way of giving back as we invest in their future and in protecting the environment for generations to come.\u201d\n\nBacardi also will plant 161 coconut trees in Puerto Rico, home to the rum distillery where BACARD\u00cd rum is produced. The trees will help regenerate and protect a beach located near the BACARD\u00cd rum distillery, an area that has suffered significant hurricane damage in recent years, it said.\n\nCorporations also are addressing environmental issues through waste reductions efforts. This spring, Constellation Brands Inc., Victor, N.Y., announced two new environmental stewardship commitments: pursuing a TRUE Zero Waste to Landfill Certification in key operating facilities and significantly enhancing its use of circular packaging across its beverage alcohol portfolio. With both commitments to be achieved by fiscal year 2025, these initiatives will be integrated into the company\u2019s annual operating plans and will further bolster Constellation\u2019s efforts to serve as good stewards of our environment and natural resources, it said.\n\nAs part of this commitment, Constellation Brands will execute plans to attain TRUE Zero Waste to Landfill Certification in its key operating facilities by further reducing operational waste across its facilities and enhancing diversion from landfills, it stated. TRUE Zero Waste to Landfill Certification is a zero waste certification program dedicated to measuring, improving, and recognizing zero waste performance by encouraging the adoption of sustainable materials management and reduction practices, according to the company.\n\nFor its enhanced circular packaging goal, Constellation Brands will reduce its ratio of packaging weight to product weight by 10% across its Wine & Spirits portfolio, it stated. The company also will ensure that 80% of packaging from its Wine & Spirits portfolio is returnable, recyclable, or renewable. Additionally, it will replace hi-cone plastic rings with recyclable paperboard for all applicable four- and six-pack SKUs across its Beer portfolio.\n\n\u201cConstellation has a long-standing commitment to operating in a manner that safeguards our environment and natural resources, and our team is laser-focused on continuing to build on this commitment through a disciplined approach and by executing targeted initiatives that are both good for our business and key stakeholders and good for the world,\u201d said Mike McGrew, Constellation Brands\u2019 executive vice president and chief communications of CSR and Diversity Officer, in a statement. \u201cOur introduction of new waste reduction and circular packaging targets is yet another example of this commitment. We look forward to continuing to work to make a positive difference in local communities where we live and work.\u201d\n\nESG efforts also are seeing companies taking a bigger look at how they can address social needs. For instance, Miller Lite and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) announced they will provide 35 scholarships to eligible undergraduate Latinx students in the United States and Puerto Rico. The scholarship also provides select recipients with career development opportunities through HACU's \u00a1Adelante! Leadership Institute, it stated.\n\nThis collaboration with HACU, a nonprofit working to improve access to and the quality of post-secondary educational opportunities for Hispanic students, has enabled Miller Lite to award more than $1 million in scholarships to empower Latinx students pursuing higher education and career opportunities, it added.\n\n\u201cLeveraging the power of diversity, equity and inclusion in leadership is an incredibly important principle within Molson Coors. Through our scholarships for Latinx students nationwide, we are actively championing this core value of supporting the Hispanic community,\u201d said Lacey Golonka, manager of community affairs for Molson Coors, in a statement at the time of the announcement. \u201cOur longstanding partnership with HACU enables us to not only provide financial support to Hispanic communities but also unlock new avenues of education, leadership development, networking and professional growth. We are committed to fostering success in students and making a positive impact within the Hispanic community through these continued opportunities.\u201d\n\nAs regulations, shareholders and consumers demand more in terms of ESG, the beverage market is likely to see more efforts from its leaders.\n\n\n\n"

            "article_text": "IBM revealed that it completed the acquisition of Envizi in a move aimed at enabling customers to accelerate environmental initiatives.\n\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nIBM, founded in 1911 and headquartered in Armonk, N.Y., is a tech giant whose offerings include Cognos Analytics With Watson -- formerly Cognos Analytics -- and the IBM Cloud Pak for Data.\n\nEnvizi, meanwhile, is an analytics vendor founded in 2004 and based in Eveleigh, Australia, with offices in London, San Francisco and Toronto and a specialization in environmental, social and governance (ESG) data.\n\nEnvironmental data\n\nThe vendor's AI-powered platform automates the collection and consolidation of more than 500 types of environmental data and is designed to enable users to analyze and report on their environmental goals and assess sustainability risk.\n\nExisting customers include Microsoft, Qantas, CBRE Group and Uber.\n\nAccording to IBM, the acquisition adds to the tech giant's growing investments in AI-powered software, which includes IBM Maximo for asset management, IBM Sterling for supply chain analysis and the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite (EIS), which all work together to enable organizations to develop resilient and sustainable operations and supply chains.\n\nSpecifically, IBM said the acquisition of Envizi will enable IBM customers to automate the information generated between corporate environmental initiatives and the endpoints used in daily operations and will make sustainability efforts more scalable. And once assimilated, Envizi will integrate with IBM Maximo, IBM Sterling, the IBM EIS and both IBM Turbonomic and Red Hat OpenShift.\n\nEnvizi, meanwhile, is a good acquisition for IBM, according to Doug Henschen, an analyst at Constellation Research.\n\nIBM moves into ESG\n\nEnvizi is a very capable, dedicated ESG analytics solution, so the acquisition quickly thrusts IBM more deeply into the ESG arena. Doug HenschenAnalyst, Constellation Research\n\n\"Envizi is a very capable, dedicated ESG analytics solution, so the acquisition quickly thrusts IBM more deeply into the ESG arena, particularly on the environmental front,\" he said. \"I see Envizi as a particularly good fit because of IBM's deep consulting bench. You don't just buy a product to address environmental, social and governance mandates and initiatives.\"\n\nWith Envizi in the fold, IBM will be able to provide customers with both guidance and technology as they develop ESG strategies and install the reporting mechanisms needed to carry out those strategies, Henschen continued.\n\n\"There's a huge need for consulting guidance as well as technology,\" he said. \"What's more, ESG is a nascent arena where standards are in flux or have yet to be written, so it's about putting the strategy and tech in place and adjusting the targets as standards and mandates evolve.\"\n\nAccording to Kareem Yusuf, general manager of IBM AI applications, the acquisition -- made public Tuesday -- will provide IBM customers with a single environment for analyzing and understanding emissions data.\n\nA sample Envizi dashboard displays data related to an organization's work to cut emissions.\n\nScaling up for Envizi\n\nDavid Solsky, co-founder and CEO of Envizi, meanwhile, said that becoming part of IBM will enable Envizi to scale much faster than it was capable of on its own. That, in turn, will help the vendor provide a broader array of customers with the tools needed to reduce the carbon footprints of their operations.\n\nWhile IBM's acquisition of Envizi is the first instance in 2022 of a vendor adding ESG analytics capabilities, Henschen said he does not expect it to be the last.\n\nHe noted that in addition to IBM, the Salesforce-Tableau combination is another enterprise that has recognized the growing importance of ESGs, and he predicted that a 2022 trend will be vendors adding more tools to enable ESG reporting.\n\nThose IBM users who take advantage of Envizi's capabilities will have to implement Envizi in addition to their existing data and analytics infrastructure.\n\nBut Henschen said he'd like to eventually see vendors make ESG tools part of their own platforms rather than accessible only through connectors and integrations.\n\n\"It's my hope, for the sake of affordability and broad adoption, that mainstream data platforms -- data warehouse/data lake -- and BI/analytics vendors will be able to come up with ESG solutions akin to their many industry solutions,\" Henschen said. \"But I expect we'll have to see more maturation and standardization in the ESG space before vendors can develop broadly applicable ESG solutions.\""

            "article_text": "Measurabl, a startup developing a platform for environmental, social and governance (ESG) data in the real estate space, today announced that it raised $93 million in a Series D funding tranche co-led by Energy Impact Partners and Sway Ventures.\n\nThe round, which Measurabl CEO Matt Ellis described as oversubscribed, brought the company\u2019s total raised to more than $170 million. Moderne Ventures, WVV, Suffolk Construction, Broadscale, Camber Creek, Salesforce Ventures, Building Ventures, Constellation Technology Ventures, Concrete Ventures, RET Ventures, Colliers and Lincoln Property Company were among the others participating.\n\n\u201cThis funding allows Measurabl to further enhance its market-leading ESG technologies, expand to new geographies and ensure the real estate industry has the investment grade data necessary to transition to a sustainable, profitable future for all,\u201d Ellis told TechCrunch in an email interview.\n\nMeasurabl, founded in 2013 by Ellis, the former director of sustainability solutions at CBRE, the commercial real estate services and investment firm, is riding the wave of startups in the ESG sector attracting serious venture backing. Measurabl offers tools for managing, benchmarking, reporting and tracking the sustainability of a real estate business, from building-level operations to boardroom and capital markets activities.\n\nMeasurabl\u2019s tech can automate the collection of electricity, water, fuel, district and waste data from utilities, for example. Or it can maintain social and governance documents alongside environmental data.\n\n\u201cMeasurabl\u2019s \u2026 solutions are critical for companies seeking to streamline their operations and gain a competitive edge in an increasingly data-driven world,\u201d Brian Nugent, a general partner at Sway Ventures, said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs the real estate industry moves toward a more sustainable future, Measurabl\u2019s innovative approach to data management will be essential in providing investment-grade reporting and analysis. This is not just a matter of meeting ESG standards; it is a financial imperative.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Dow Jones survey, ESG investments are projected to more than double in the next three years, accounting for 15% of all investments by 2025. But recent U.S. political headwinds, such as an attempt spearheaded by Senate and House Republicans to overturn a Labor Department rule allowing retirement plans to consider ESG factors when making investment decisions, threaten to depress the market\u2019s growth.\n\nCase in point: During the final months of 2022, investors pulled nearly $6.2 billion more out of sustainable funds than they put in, according to Morningstar.\n\nMeasurabl\u2019s successful financing would suggest that there\u2019s still an appetite for ESG, though. The company\u2019s momentum most likely had something to do with it; Measurabl has over 1,000 customers and claims to be used by 40% of global real estate asset managers.\n\nAnother factor in Measurabl\u2019s favor is the increasing pressure on the real estate market to change \u2014 often in the form of municipal-level carbon emissions laws. (According to one source, real estate drives roughly 39% of total worldwide emissions \u2014 much of it generated by manufacturing materials used in buildings and the rest from the buildings themselves and generating energy to power the buildings.) Estimates out of the U.N. climate conference COP26 suggest that $14 trillion of buildings will be uninsurable over the next 20 years if they don\u2019t meet climate and efficiency standards.\n\n\u201cMeasurabl is the world\u2019s most widely adopted ESG data management platform for real estate,\u201d Ellis said. \u201c[Customers use it to] decarbonize buildings, mitigate physical climate risk, comply with regulation and underwrite sustainability risks in real estate transactions.\u201d"

And so he must give back to the generations that follow. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten his words,\u201d he says now. \u201cWith every decision I make, I am defining the future for those who come after me.\u201d As CSO of the national non-profit First Nations Major Projects Coalition\u2014a 152-nation collective that seeks equity in projects like pipelines and gas utilities\u2014Podlasly counsels Indigenous governments coast to coast on how to establish trusts and invest revenues from resource development. \u201cWhat gives me the most pride,\u201d he says, \u201cis seeing how Indigenous nations are starting to re-emerge as true economic and thought partners within Canada.\u201d\n\nRoberto Cipriani\n\nCTO and COO, Paper\n\nIn a perfect world, every child would have equitable access to education.

He leveraged his engineering background to lead two major tech acquisitions, spearheaded an AI-enabled essay review service, and raised more than $390 million in funding, which brought Paper to a $1.5-billion valuation.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Theresa JangCOOPER & O\u2019HARA/The Globe and Mail\n\nTheresa Jang\n\nCFO, Stantec\n\nWhen Theresa Jang stepped into the CFO seat in 2018, it was a challenging time for Stantec. The Edmonton-based engineering firm was still digesting its largest-ever acquisition, of MWH Global in 2016, and the construction services business line it got in the deal was underperforming. Stantec was feeling the chill from investors; Jang\u2019s first task was to thaw relations.\n\nDivesting the problem business unit and delivering four straight quarters of solid performance certainly helped. But beyond that, the strategy was to set expectations for investors and deliver\u2014and make sure they understood the company\u2019s business went beyond designing roads and bridges.\n\nTake, for example, Stantec\u2019s environmental consulting business, which involves hiring archaeologists and paleontologists, conducting bat studies and assessing areas of cultural significance to Indigenous communities. Jang worked with experts from across Stantec to ground herself in these more opaque business lines so she could explain them to investors. \u201cIf they could gain that insight, they could connect with how relevant all the things we\u2019re doing in society are today,\u201d she says.\n\nAs for delivering on expectations, Stantec has outperformed on \u201cvirtually every measure\u201d of its three-year strategic plan (which became a four-year plan due to the pandemic), released at the end of 2019. Under Jang\u2019s tenure, the firm has made 16 acquisitions, steadily growing its global footprint, and achieved a total shareholder return of 304% over the past four years. In 2023 alone, its share price increased 64%, and its total shareholder return was 65%.\n\n\u201cHer input into our strategic and business planning has not just been helpful\u2014it\u2019s been absolutely invaluable,\u201d says CEO Gord Johnston, who also praises Jang\u2019s \u201cremarkable knack for forging relationships.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Johnston credits Jang\u2019s work as chair of the executive environmental, social and governance (ESG) committee with helping to cement Stantec\u2019s reputation as a sustainability leader. In 2019, the company became the first in its sector to quantify a percentage of revenues from projects that support sustainability goals\u2014at 43%, or $2.1 billion\u2014in response to a common request from investors. The move prompted the firm\u2019s peers to follow suit and pushed Stantec to keep upping its game. In 2022, the metric had increased to 60%, or $3.4 billion in revenue.\n\nFurthermore, Jang spearheaded an agreement to turn Stantec\u2019s $1.1-billion senior credit facility into a sustainability-linked loan, where the rate of interest charged is tied to the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and its score on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. If it meets the targets, savings from the reduction in interest costs go back to local communities. Thanks to a mix of higher interest rates and meeting its targets, she says the company has a \u201cpretty healthy\u201d amount to donate this year.\n\nIt\u2019s achievements like these that Jang hopes will be her lasting mark on Stantec when she retires, which she\u2019s set to do later this year, once the company finds her successor. \u201cI hope employees will remember what comes from setting ambitious targets to up our performance, delivering on them, and the benefits and value that gets created from doing that,\u201d she says. \u2013 Kelsey Rolfe\n\nLori Bieda\n\nChief data and analytics officer, North American personal and business bank, and head of enterprise CRM, BMO\n\nFor 30 years, Bieda has used strategic data insights to guide Fortune 500 companies around the globe. But in a twist for a metrics-oriented executive, she makes a point to look well beyond the numbers. \u201cIf an analytical empath were a thing, that would capture how I think and lead,\u201d she says. \u201cI set out to help people get where they want to go\u2014and to have a blast doing it.\u201d In 2023, her AI expertise earned her BMO team the Digital Banker\u2019s Global Retail Banking Innovation Award for outstanding machine learning initiative. Meanwhile, she oversees BMO\u2019s \u201canalytics university,\u201d which the bank uses to rapidly scale up and teach staff across all disciplines of data and analytics. And she created ElleExcel Women\u2019s Circle, which empowers women in STEM through webcasts, blogs and a match-up program.\n\nLauren Steinberg\n\nSVP media, loyalty and Loblaw digital, Loblaw\n\nThere\u2019s trial by fire, and then there\u2019s getting promoted to SVP digital of Loblaw at the start of a pandemic\u2014when more than two million people suddenly began buying their groceries online. \u201cWe started generating billions of dollars in business through this pretty archaic technology infrastructure,\u201d she says. Steinberg\u2019s response was to migrate the firm from a third-party, out-of-the-box e-commerce platform to a custom, in-house one called Helios, which helped scale its grocery, apparel and beauty arms\u2014all in less than a year. It\u2019s a system that has other retailers reaching out to ask her how it was done so efficiently. \u201cI think that\u2019s really great for our team, to know that we are leaders in this space,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have a culture of humility, and that\u2019s good and bad. You want teams to be able to brag.\u201d Steinberg also overhauled Loblaw\u2019s recruiting, introduced online coaching, and started a series of internal innovation conferences, which improved employee engagement and dropped voluntary attrition to less than 10%. Somehow, she found time to help develop Garfielld, the company\u2019s proprietary generative AI. And as a queer woman in tech, she spearheaded inclusivity training for all Loblaw digital staff and established a multiyear partnership with the Black Professionals in Tech Network.\n\nEhsan Mokhtari\n\nCTO, ChargeLab\n\nWhen Mokhtari joined ChargeLab, which creates EV charging software, it was seeing promising traction with a handful of early customers. There was just one problem: The tech wasn\u2019t scalable. That precluded outside investment and, in turn, any major growth. Mokhtari changed all that. Drawing on his strong background in cybersecurity, including having co-invented two U.S. patents and published in multiple peer-reviewed journals, he completely re-engineered the platform to make it scalable\u2014and did so without outsourcing engineering talent outside Canada. \u201cI am driven by the desire to solve problems that improve people\u2019s lives, whether by simplifying tasks or alleviating pain points,\u201d he says. \u201cBuilding solutions that bring order to complexity and create value for humanity is deeply satisfying.\u201d\n\nStuart Auld\n\nCFO, Wajax\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to effectively tackle a complex problem\u2014say, unifying three separate companies, as Auld helped industrial product and service provider Wajax do in 2016. (Under his financial stewardship, Wajax has seen annual revenue growth of 8%, to over $2 billion, and earnings growth exceeding 21% a year.) It\u2019s another to make a habit of finding the signal through the noise. During a recent executive transition that ushered in new CEO Iggy Domagalski, Auld assumed responsibility for supply chain, real estate and enterprise real estate management. \u201cHe provided crucial guidance and expertise, contributing significantly to our success in the first two years of my tenure,\u201d says Domagalski. Amid myriad responsibilities that might have bogged down a less clear-eyed executive, he kept his focus\u2014and maintained communication so clear that it streamlined decision-making and kept his team in line with Wajax\u2019s wider objectives.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: David SimmondsDUANE COLE/The Globe and Mail\n\nDavid Simmonds\n\nSVP and global chief communications and sustainability officer, Great-West Lifeco and Canada Life\n\nDavid Simmonds learned a valuable lesson early in his career, while working in policy and communications: You can be the world\u2019s best storyteller, but if the idea you\u2019re trying to sell isn\u2019t sound, people won\u2019t buy in.\n\nAs head of sustainability at 175-year-old Great-West, Simmonds used that notion as a guiding principle when developing, designing and executing its ESG strategy and framework. Since resilience has always been critical to Great-West, given its generational commitment to customers, setting rigorous ESG targets is just good business, he says: \u201cA resilient company is a diverse company. It\u2019s a sustainable company.\u201d\n\nSimmonds helped Great-West shake some of the risk aversion inherent to a financial services company with roots in life insurance, says president and CEO Paul Mahon, who characterizes Simmonds as having a mix of passion and pragmatism. \u201cHe\u2019s given us the confidence to be more proactive than we ever have been before,\u201d he says.\n\nFor example, under Simmonds\u2019s leadership, the company issued its first sustainability report with a plan to achieve net zero on greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, as well as interim 2030 targets to lower operational emissions by 40% and reduce its investment carbon footprint by 37% (compared to 2019 levels). He also helped set ambitious workforce diversity targets, including a goal of 50% women and 25% underrepresented groups in leadership positions.\n\nSimmonds has been pushing the envelope outside of Great-West, too. During his 2022 term as president of the Canadian Club, he was instrumental in recruiting one of the most diverse boards in the organization\u2019s history, but only after pushing its leadership to host a broader range of programming\u2014from events on Black joy and economic reconciliation to the meaning of drag and the LGBTQ+ community\u2014which signalled it was a welcoming space for executives from underrepresented groups. And last year, he chaired a committee to help Sunnybrook Hospital with its rebranding efforts, resulting in the Wes Anderson\u2013inspired \u201cThis Place is Special\u201d campaign that highlighted its diverse employee population and patients.\n\nThis past December, Great-West released a progress report on its sustainability goals, showing strong results. The numbers on diversity were especially positive\u2014with 41% women leaders and 20% from underrepresented groups\u2014thanks in part to an employment equity action plan meant to improve the attraction, retention, growth and promotion of diverse talent within the organization.\n\nBut for Simmonds, even the mere act of sharing the update felt like progress. \u201cWe\u2019re holding our goals out there, and that\u2019s super important,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes me feel like we\u2019re changing the business in a helpful way.\u201d \u2013 KR\n\nMicheline Davies\n\nSVP automotive and chief merchant, Canadian Tire\n\nLast year, Davies was promoted to chief mer-chant\u2014the first woman to hold the position in Canadian Tire\u2019s 101-year history. Before that, she shepherded the firm\u2019s auto repair business squarely into 2023, introducing the auto care program, which provided stores with tablets that allow real-time communication with customers, along with a 24-hour online booking system and digital vehicle inspections. \u201cWe\u2019ve found 20% to 25% of bookings happen after hours, so it helps us recover some sales that we might not have received otherwise, which is great,\u201d she says. The result was the firm\u2019s best-ever year of auto service. She\u2019s also steering Canadian Tire into the EV era. And when she\u2019s not driving record results, Davies advocates for women and diversity through the Canadian Tire Women\u2019s Leadership Network, which she founded in 2014.\n\nMark Miller\n\nCOO, Constellation Software\n\nConstellation is an acquisition machine specializing in buying software vendors that serve specific verticals. Miller, a stats-and-math grad from McMaster University, has been there for 20-plus years, helping it become one of Canada\u2019s most valuable public companies. He\u2019s also executive chair of one of Constellation\u2019s seven operating groups, Volaris. Media-shy president Mark Leonard puts a lot of trust in his leaders, who run their own acquisition campaigns. To be honest, we could have picked any one of them for this award, such is the depth and calibre of talent at Constellation, which has delivered 12 straight quarters of organic revenue growth.\n\nAndrew Booth\n\nCFO, AbCellera\n\nUnder Booth, the Vancouver-based biotech firm has grown fast, expanding to 600 people from 70 since he joined. The secret is careful preparation combined with a willingness to seize the moment. Booth and his colleagues created a detailed long-term plan for the company, but when the pandemic made urgent action necessary, \u201cwe didn\u2019t hesitate in making the decision to move,\u201d he says. They executed their entire plan, including an IPO, in little over a year. It left them with around $1 billion in available liquidity, which Booth intends to use to build a long-lasting Canadian biotech firm: \u201cOur successes,\u201d he says, \u201care going to be measured in decades.\u201d\n\nTara Deakin\n\nChief people officer, Spin Master\n\nWhen Deakin considers a new initiative, she asks herself the following: Does it work in practical terms, what could be better, and can it scale and be repeated? With her pragmatic approach and broad portfolio\u2014she\u2019s worked in companies big and small, domestic and global, public and private, founder-led and professionally managed\u2014Deakin made big strides to reignite Spin Master\u2019s employee experience. The percentage of staff who are proud to work at the multicategory children\u2019s entertainment company hit 88% in 2023\u2014an all-time high. To get there, Deakin created a unified rewards strategy for its 2,000 global employees, enhanced their benefits, and instituted universal four-week vacation, among other improvements. Meanwhile, she helped shepherd the firm through key executive changes and propelled its progress toward sustainable toys, including a 100% recycled Rubik\u2019s Cube. Now, she\u2019s helping integrate the $950-million acquisition of wooden toy brand Melissa & Doug. \u201cMy curiosity keeps me motivated,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe we can always rethink how an organization works. How can we do better tomorrow than we did today?\u201d\n\nJordan Cole\n\nChief commercial officer, Hydrostor\n\nIn January 2023, Hydrostor\u2014a Toronto-based developer and operator of long-term energy storage systems\u2014signed a nearly $1-billion contract with a California utility to provide clean electricity for 500,000-plus customers over 25 years. It was one of the largest energy-storage contracts in history, and it happened under the stewardship of Cole, who joined the company in 2017. Since then, he\u2019s helped guide the firm from focusing solely on developing tech to independently developing projects. \u201cThis was a significant undertaking, but it led to our successful large-scale pursuits in Canada, California, Australia and other markets globally,\u201d he says.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Eric MylesSylvie Li/The Globe and Mail\n\nEric Myles\n\nChief sport officer, Canadian Olympic Committee\n\nYou might think the man behind some of Canada\u2019s best Olympic showings ever\u2014including an unprecedented 29 medals at the PyeongChang 2018 winter games and 24 medals at the 2020 Tokyo summer games\u2014would be an unrelenting taskmaster with a philosophy of winning at any cost. But that\u2019s not how Eric Myles, chief sport officer of the Canadian Olympic Committee and head of Canada\u2019s Olympic teams, rolls. Sports executives who care only about winning suffer from \u201ctunnel vision,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we just burn people out, how sustainable is that?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Myles\u2014who is responsible for the development and execution of the COC\u2019s long-term and annual strategic plan\u2014focuses just as much on the wellbeing of athletes, including their mental health, as he does on planning for competitions at the Olympic, Pan American and Youth Olympic Games.\n\nIt\u2019s the culmination of a commitment that goes back to his early days as an athlete and a member of the medal-winning Canadian canoe team at the 1987 Pan Am games. Even then, Myles recalls, teammates sought him out for help, which eventually led him into teaching and communications, as well as co-founding Qu\u00e9bec en Forme, an organization that encourages healthy eating and active living. When he joined the COC in 2014, he was tasked with building up the organization\u2019s athlete relationships team, and helping to launch Game Plan, a program that helps athletes plan for their long-term future\u2014not only in terms of health, but also building a career after their days in competitive sport are over, the way Myles did.\n\nSince moving into his current role in 2016, Myles has continued to advocate for a fair and inclusive sport system in Canada and around the world. For example, he played a role in developing the Canadian Sport Governance Code to increase accountability and representation in sports organizations. And he keeps working to make athlete health a fundamental part of the job: He recently persuaded Mike Wilkinson, a top sports doctor for Canada\u2019s Olympic teams, to join the COC full-time as its first-ever chief medical officer for health and wellness, and he successfully advocated for the federal government to provide increased resources for Canadian athletes, more than doubling their access to mental health support.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of his view that, in spite of Canada\u2019s Olympic success during his tenure, the big challenge is to make sports a safer and happier place in the long run, while still delivering short-term results. \u201cIt\u2019s our Canadian way of winning,\u201d he says, noting that other countries don\u2019t necessarily share that perspective. \u201cI won\u2019t get on the negative side, but we see it in the media, countries that do it differently. That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s their choice.\u201d\n\nSo far, the Canadian way seems to be working when Myles is in charge, and he looks forward to proving it again at the Olympics in Paris this summer. \u201cI think Canadians will be surprised and inspired by how talented Team Canada is at these Games. We have medal potential across so many sports and amazing athletes,\u201d he says. \u201cThey will inspire a new generation.\u201d \u2013 Jaime Weinman\n\nJennifer Quinn\n\nChief strategy and development officer, Nieuport Aviation Infrastructure Partners\n\nWhen Quinn joined Nieuport, which owns and operates the passenger terminal building at Toronto\u2019s Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, the pandemic had shuttered its commercial operations for 18 months. Her deft piloting of its return to service garnered the business a Most Spectacular Business Recovery award from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce\u2014even though she went in with no aviation experience. Meanwhile, she led the establishment of a U.S. customs preclearance facility, increased Nieuport\u2019s GRESB score (the industry benchmark for ESG performance) to 85% from 77%, and is championing the electrification of the airport\u2019s shuttle service.\n\nSomen Mondal\n\nGeneral manager, Dayforce Talent, Dayforce\n\nMondal joined Dayforce (formerly Ceridian) through an acquisition of Ideal, a company he co-founded and led. He leveraged his deep data, AI and talent management expertise to re-imagine the Dayforce Talent suite of products (onboarding, career development, compensation management and more). Under his leadership, Dayforce Talent achieved high-double-digit revenue growth and is now the fastest-growing Dayforce product area. He also led an initiative ensuring employees were given 2% of their time for career development opportunities.\n\nSteve Berna\n\nCOO, First Nations Finance Authority\n\nSince its first bond deal in 2014, the FNFA\u2014a unique non-profit owned and controlled by its member First Nations\u2014has issued more than $2 billion in long-term, low-interest loans to communities to fund infrastructure and pursue investments. Those projects range from community housing, schools and water systems to loans that supported the blockbuster acquisition of North America\u2019s largest shellfish company, Clearwater Seafoods, by a consortium of Mi\u2019kmaq communities in 2020. Berna was key to helping the organization get to this point, tackling red tape so its member communities would be recognized as a level of government, with the same fundraising powers as municipalities. To accomplish that, he rallied support from rating agencies and capital market investors for Ottawa to amend the legislation under which the FNFA was created so communities could secure loans using own-source revenues like taxation, royalties and proceeds from business ventures. \u201cSteve is a dedicated leader who effectively manages his team\u2019s training in understanding the capital markets to improve access to affordable capital,\u201d says FNFA CEO Ernie Daniels. \u201cHe also cultivates and maintains relationships with rating agencies, investors and the banking syndicate to ensure that FNFA\u2019s members have consistent access to the financing that meets their community planning needs.\u201d\n\nNancy Morison\n\nVP, supply chain and Delta ophthalmic laboratory, FYihealth group\n\nSince taking over the eye-care provider\u2019s Delta, B.C., lab in 2017, Morison became known for improving employee en-gagement, which is partly why FYi transferred customer service to her office. Her authenticity is what drives that reputation: Morison tries to show interest in every employee, walking the floor to have personal conversations and give voice to those who don\u2019t feel comfortable speaking up in formal meetings. It\u2019s all part of her ethos of \u201ca servant kind of leadership,\u201d she says, and asking staff, \u201cWhat do you need? How can I help? How can we improve?\u201d\n\nSandy Sharman\n\nSenior EVP and group head, people, culture and brand, CIBC\n\nTo paraphrase Drake, she started from the bottom, now she\u2019s here. Sharman\u2019s first job in banking was as a teller, at a branch in Brampton, Ont. Now the Dalhousie University MBA runs a significant portion of CIBC and is one of CEO Victor Dodig\u2019s key advisers. When CIBC moved its head office into a new tower, Sharman used it as an opportunity to transform the workplace, combining teams from across the bank in open-concept spaces. Since being named head of HR in 2014, she has picked up numerous additional responsibilities, including marketing, client experience, sponsorships, community investment and communications. She\u2019s also on the board of TransAlta, one of Alberta\u2019s largest renewable-energy producers.\n\nAli Hoss\n\nChief sustainability officer, Triovest\n\nWhen Hoss joined the real estate development and investment firm, he realized that sustainability needed to be integrated into every facet of the business. He led the process of making ESG metrics part of the bonus structure, which he says encourages employees to rank long-term goals involving \u201cthe environment, building occupants and the community at large\u201d alongside traditional short-term goals. Hoss also created Triovest Sustainability Solutions, a platform to develop and execute ESG strategies, implementing everything from training and education to \u201csophisticated decarbonization planning and climate risk assessments.\u201d\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Daphn\u00e9 MollotSylvie Li/The Globe and Mail\n\nDaphn\u00e9 Mollot\n\nVP of innovation, Groupe Marcelle Inc.\n\nAt the top rungs of Lise Watier, a pioneering Canadian cosmetics brand founded in 1972, and its parent company Groupe Marcelle, the reigning view is this: Without Daphn\u00e9 Mollot, there would be no Lise Watier. She\u2019s been a pillar of the organization since 1974, when she started working with its eponymous founder. And while an industry veteran with more than 50 years\u2019 tenure could easily rest on her laurels, that has never been Mollot\u2019s style. \u201cWith all the economic turbulence we face, there\u2019s an opportunity for brands to embrace change,\u201d she says. \u201cI like the idea of moving away from complex, traditional models to something leaner, more organic and more agile. As for me, I\u2019m always learning\u2014and I hope I\u2019m still growing.\u201d\n\nAdaptability has been Mollot\u2019s north star from the get-go. For one thing, she\u2019s a firm believer in cross-disciplinary expertise. She\u2019s held leadership positions in virtually every arm of the organization, from product formulation, innovation and marketing to operations and business development. But above all? \u201cI\u2019m a bit of an anthropologist,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, it all comes down to the consumer. She is the one who decides whether or not you\u2019re successful. If you do a great job with marketing, you will attract her. But she will only come back if a product delivers on its promises.\u201d\n\nIn other words, long-term success demands a wraparound strategy from development to marketing\u2014neglect any step at your peril. But you can\u2019t build a comprehensive business strategy without tending to your relationships. Fortunately, balancing strategic acumen with genuine human connection is where Mollot really shines.\n\nHer knack for fostering lasting partnerships with suppliers, retailers, team members, all the way down to customers and in-store beauty advisers, is less about conventional networking and more about cultivating meaningful relationships that will stand the test of time. In industry circles, she\u2019s a household name. In the office, she has an open-door policy. \u201cWhen Daphn\u00e9 walks down the aisles of major cosmetics shows, everybody calls out to her,\u201d says Groupe Marcelle president David Cape. \u201cAnd she really wants to bring the younger generation along, and teach them how to create and market products that fit the Watier brand. She\u2019s lived through generations of the industry, and her knowledge is virtually encyclopedic.\u201d\n\nMollot\u2019s latest pivot? She\u2019s helping steer Watier through a rebrand, dropping the \u201cLise\u201d in favour of a snappier name\u2014and moving away from \u201canti-aging\u201d messaging toward embracing beauty at every age, with the tagline \u201cYour Best Age is Now.\u201d \u201cWe were never afraid of valorizing women, but today, we\u2019re doing it in a different way,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, the status quo is just not an option.\u201d \u2013Liza Agrba\n\nLisa Mazurkewich\n\nHead of marketing, Subway Canada\n\nIn her first year and a half in this role, Mazurkewich changed not only Subway\u2019s marketing, but also the things being marketed\u2014including 15 new sandwiches on the menu. \u201cWhile Subway has always been known for \u2018build your own,\u2019 we wanted to create new chef-crafted subs,\u201d she says. She then vastly increased business with a campaign called YesWay, aimed at young people skeptical that a brand like Subway could change so much, so fast. \u201cThe campaign broke through because we acknowledged that skepticism and created a rallying cry,\u201d she says. The proof? Sales increased 438% above target and foot traffic by 379%.\n\nDoug Nathanson\n\nEVP, chief development officer and general counsel, Empire Co. and Sobeys Inc.\n\nNathanson, who ran Em-pire\u2019s legal team, now does everything from real estate to public relations. \u201cI get to do some of the legal work still, like in our acquisitions of Farm Boy and Longo\u2019s,\u201d he says. He\u2019s also been working on the rollout of the company\u2019s online platform, Voil\u00e0, more closely than planned: \u201cWhen the head of Voil\u00e0 took maternity leave, I was lucky enough to get to step into her shoes and be in charge for a short period.\u201d While all that went on, he was \u201cexceptionally proud\u201d to be part of the team creating an industry-wide code of conduct.\n\nKevin Jackson\n\nPresident, Porter Airlines\n\nPost-pandemic, Jackson thought it was time for Porter to be \u201cmuch more aggressive than previously envisioned\u201d with its plan to expand across the continent. To that end, the airline decided to focus less on benefits for business-class passengers and instead direct more perks to \u201cthe vast majority of people who don\u2019t qualify for meaningful frequent-flyer benefits with other carriers,\u201d he says. This shift has been especially helpful to Porter\u2019s expansion efforts \u201cin markets where there has been little choice and consumers feel they\u2019ve been taken advantage of,\u201d says Jackson\u2014and it\u2019s part of the reason why Porter\u2019s revenue doubled in 2023 and is on track to do so again.\n\nChuck We\n\nEVP, Pacific Northwest/Canada office operations, Hudson Pacific Properties\n\nAfter Hudson Pacific acquired the Bentall Centre in Vancouver, We built a team combining the previous management\u2019s employees with new ones. He\u2019s proud he could help shape \u201cone cohesive culture\u201d out of this combination and build a diverse team \u201crepresentative of the community we\u2019re working in,\u201d says We. He also added a placemaking and events team, whose efforts have helped the company in unexpected ways, like luring employees away from remote work. \u201cPeople are looking at us to \u2018earn their commute\u2019 and come back to the office,\u201d he says.\n\nLaura Devoni\n\nDirector of strategy, corporate affairs and sustainability, Algoma Steel\n\nA 20-year Algoma veteran who helped the steel giant build relationships with communities such as the Batchewana First Nation, Devoni loves her role for letting her focus equally on internal and external work. She advocated for transparent ESG reporting to \u201cshare our story to build pride culturally\u201d with outsiders, but also worked within Algoma to develop a sustainability plan for green steel. In addition, Devoni continues to mentor women in the male-dominated industry. \u201cOne individual comes to mind who joined my team temporarily as a summer student,\u201d she says. \u201cSix years later, she is thriving as a young professional.\u201d\n\nSharon Geraghty\n\nGeneral counsel and EVP, Great-West Lifeco\n\nIn 2018, one of Canada\u2019s largest life insurers quietly launched a strategic pivot. Winnipeg-based Great-West, controlled by the Desmarais family, began beefing up its wealth management business with takeovers on both sides of the border. Over the next six years, Geraghty quarterbacked a series of multibillion-dollar deals, including exiting underperforming U.S. mutual fund manager Putnam Investments. Great-West\u2019s evolution is thrilling investors\u2014the stock price is up more than 30%\u2014a compelling second chapter in Geraghty\u2019s career history, which already saw her reshape corporate Canada as a top mergers-and-acquisitions partner at law firm Torys.\n\nLuigi Pozzebon\n\nVP, satellite systems, MDA\n\nPozzebon, originally an engineer, became chief architect and now heads up MDA\u2019s satellite business, whose team has doubled in size in the past two years, to more than 1,200. He feels his technical background is his greatest strength: \u201cI\u2019m quite capable to participate in the technical review, as well as the business review,\u201d he says. Pozzebon\u2019s team created game-changing digital satellite technology that helped MDA land its biggest-ever contract: a $2.1-billion deal with Telesat, which will use the tech in its Lightspeed LEO (low-Earth orbit) constellation. Now he has to transform the satellite business to meet demand. \u201cOur high-volume production is going to look like recreational vehicle production lines,\u201d Pozzebon forecasts.\n\nJonathan Goler\n\nEVP, chief risk officer, Propel\n\nSince co-founding Propel in 2011, Goler\u2014who\u2019s studied and worked in AI for decades\u2014has made the fintech a leading force in using predictive AI to assess lending risk. Traditional tools like credit scores lock out many consumers with checkered or non-existent credit histories. Goler\u2019s AI-powered platform and risk model make it possible to accurately price risk for underbanked and underserved consumers, looking at 5,000-plus consumer data points, assessing the risk of a loan in under six seconds, and processing more than 40,000 applications a day. The result? Loan-loss provisions have gone down by more than 50%, even as Propel\u2019s products are used to extend credit to more customers. Goler is also a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community and dad to two young daughters, ensuring his employees feel comfortable bringing their whole selves to work.\n\nMahima Poddar\n\nSVP and group head, personal banking, Equitable Bank\n\nPoddar has grown Equitable Bank by $9 billion since 2021, with special emphasis on expanding the company\u2019s digital platform, EQ Bank. She more than tripled EQ Bank\u2019s product development pace and moved swiftly to shift EQ to cloud-based technology. The changes, she says, allowed it to accept twice as many customers as the bank could have under the old system. Poddar has also been a leader in employee opportunity, spearheading a talent review of Equitable\u2019s mortgage team to identify unconscious bias and help connect employees \u201cto new roles and growth opportunities they would not have otherwise seen for themselves.\u201d The result was more women promoted to leadership positions, as well as improved professional development for many other employees.\n\nLaura Money\n\nEVP, chief information and technology innovation officer, Sun Life Financial\n\nMoney has a lot on her plate, steering the digital transformation of a 160-year-old fi-nancial institution. That means her job touches on everything from integrating the $365-million acquisition of telehealth provider Dialogue Health Technologies (which has 2.8 million members across 50,000 organizations) to experimenting with generative AI. Money, who has a degree in industrial engineering and an MBA, joined Sun Life in 2020 after holding VP jobs at three of the big Canadian banks. She\u2019s been recognized as one of North America\u2019s top 10 women CIOs and one of Canada\u2019s most powerful women. Her volunteer stints include board-chair roles with cancer and opera organizations, and she has completed marathons, triathlons and ski mountaineering races.\n\nWith files from Andrew Willis, Sean Silcoff and Jason Kirby"

In-depth interviews were conducted with various primary respondents, including key opinion leaders; subject matter experts on circularity and sustainability, third-party service providers, consulting service providers, and end users; high-level executives of multiple companies offering green technology & sustainability & services; and industry consultants to obtain and verify critical qualitative and quantitative information and assess the market prospects and industry trends.\n\nSecondary Research\n\nIn the secondary research process, various secondary sources were referred to for identifying and collecting information for the study. The secondary sources included annual reports; press releases and investor presentations of companies; white papers, certified publications such as Journal of Industrial Ecology, International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management, International Journal of Green Economics, GAIA: Ecological Perspectives for Science and Society; and articles from recognized associations and government publishing sources including but not limited to United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR), Ellen MacArthur Foundation, World Resources Institute (WRI), European Environmental Agency, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).\n\nThe secondary research was used to obtain key information about the industry\u2019s value chain, the market\u2019s monetary chain, the overall pool of key players, market classification and segmentation according to industry trends to the bottom-most level, regional markets, and key developments from the market and technology-oriented perspectives.\n\nPrimary Research\n\nIn the primary research process, a diverse range of stakeholders from both the supply and demand sides of the green technology & sustainability ecosystem were interviewed to gather qualitative and quantitative insights specific to this market. From the supply side, key industry experts, such as chief executive officers (CEOs), vice presidents (VPs), marketing directors, technology & innovation directors, as well as technical leads from vendors offering green technology & sustainability & services were consulted. Additionally, system integrators, service providers, and IT service firms that implement and support green technology & sustainability were included in the study. On the demand side, input from IT decision-makers, infrastructure managers, and sustainability/circular economy heads was collected to understand the user perspectives and adoption challenges within targeted industries.\n\nThe primary research ensured that all crucial parameters affecting the green technology & sustainability market\u2014from technological advancements and evolving use cases (Corporate ESG & compliance, energy & emission reduction, sustainable supply chain & logistics etc.) to regulatory and compliance needs (US Clean Power Plan, EU Green Deal, NAPCC India, PNMC Brazil etc.) were considered. Each factor was thoroughly analyzed, verified through primary research, and evaluated to obtain precise quantitative and qualitative data for this market.\n\nOnce the initial phase of market engineering was completed, including detailed calculations for market statistics, segment-specific growth forecasts, and data triangulation, an additional round of primary research was undertaken. This step was crucial for refining and validating critical data points, such as green technology & sustainability offerings (green technology & sustainability software & services), industry adoption trends, the competitive landscape, and key market dynamics like demand drivers (Rise in government initiatives for low-carbon policies, corporate net-zero & ESG commitments, consumer demand for sustainable products & services, energy transition & decarbonization goals), challenges (Data Complexity & lack of standardized reporting frameworks, lack of tailored solutions to address unique environmental issues), and opportunities (Expansion of water-tech & smart resource management, growth in AI & digital carbon management solutions, carbon markets & decentralized trading platforms).\n\nIn the complete market engineering process, the top-down and bottom-up approaches and several data triangulation methods were extensively used to perform the market estimation and market forecast for the overall market segments and subsegments listed in this report. Extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed on the complete market engineering process to record the critical information/insights throughout the report.\n\nNote: Three tiers of companies are defined based on their total revenue as of 2024; tier 1 = revenue more than USD 1 billion, tier 2 = revenue between USD 1 billion and 500 million, tier 3 = revenue less than USD 500 million\n\nSource: MarketsandMarkets Analysis\n\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study, download the pdf brochure\n\nMarket Size Estimation To estimate and forecast the green technology & sustainability market and its dependent submarkets, both top-down and bottom-up approaches were employed. This multi-layered analysis was further reinforced through data triangulation, incorporating both primary and secondary research inputs. The market figures were also validated against the existing MarketsandMarkets repository for accuracy. The following research methodology has been used to estimate the market size: Green Technology & Sustainability Market : Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approach Data Triangulation After arriving at the overall market size using the market size estimation processes as explained above, the market was split into several segments and subsegments. To complete the overall market engineering process and arrive at the exact statistics of each market segment and subsegment, data triangulation and market breakup procedures were employed, wherever applicable. The overall market size was then used in the top-down procedure to estimate the size of other individual markets via percentage splits of the market segmentation.\n\nMarket Definition The green technology & sustainability market encompasses digital solutions that enable industries to track, optimize, and reduce their environmental impact through AI-driven intelligence, blockchain-enabled transparency, and cloud-based sustainability management. Unlike traditional sustainability efforts focused on material recovery, energy offsets, and waste management, this market is centered on software-driven decarbonization, ESG compliance, and real-time emissions intelligence. Key technologies such as carbon accounting platforms, supply chain traceability tools, AI-powered energy management software, and sustainability analytics dashboards empower enterprises to integrate environmental responsibility into their core business operations. With industries under increasing regulatory and stakeholder pressure to disclose Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, the role of digital sustainability intelligence has evolved from a compliance function to a strategic imperative for long-term business resilience, operational efficiency, and climate risk mitigation.

(NYSE: STZ), a leading beverage alcohol company, today announced the release of its 2023 ESG Impact Report and expanded target to restore a total of 5 billion gallons of its water withdrawals back to local watersheds near the company\u2019s production facilities between its fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2025.\n\nExceeded previous water stewardship target ahead of schedule, continues progress against all environmental targets.\n\nConstellation achieved its original target to restore approximately 1.1 billion gallons of water withdrawals from local watersheds ahead of plan and is now targeting to restore an incremental 4 billion gallons.
