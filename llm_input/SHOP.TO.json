Corporate sustainability strategy is one that all businesses will be considering for the foreseeable to meet the needs of the Paris Agreement and those set out by COP26. The other is supply chain transparency, which is crucial for understanding exactly where resources come from and where they end up.\n\nThere are many areas of the supply chain that will require address from now, which are beyond immediate supply chain operations. Energy sourcing is critical for meeting climate deadlines, but also the emissions incorporated in Scope 2 and Scope 3\u2014which businesses will struggle to control without better use of data. Operatives within the supply chain need to be aware of supply chain credentials, but can only do so with a clear sustainability strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo catch the latest from Sustainability LIVE and watch all sessions on-demand, visit the Sustainability Magazine YouTube channel .\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more supply chain content, Procurement & Supply Chain LIVE is back for more industry insights at Tobacco Dock, London."

Get exclusive investment industry news and insights, the week\u2019s top headlines, and what you and your clients need to know. For more from Globe Advisor, visit our homepage.\n\nKen O\u2019Kennedy isn\u2019t making predictions about if or when interest rates will drop this year \u2013 or by how much.\n\nInstead, the chief investment officer at Vancouver-based Dixon Mitchell Investment Counsel Inc. prefers to focus on analyzing and understanding businesses he can own long term, regardless of the interest-rate environment.\n\nThe fundamental buy-and-hold strategy has helped his team achieve double-digit returns in recent years.\n\nThe Dixon Mitchell Total Equity Portfolio, with $1.5-billion in assets under management (AUM), has returned 16 per cent over the past year. Its three-year annualized return is 15.7 per cent, while its five-year annualized return is 14.2 per cent. The returns, as of Jan. 31, are gross of fees, which vary by the client and range between 0.8 and 1 per cent.\n\nThe five top holdings in the portfolio are Visa Corp. V-N (6.2 per cent), Dollarama Inc. DOL-T (5.9 per cent), Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG-Q (5.6 per cent), Berkshire-Hathaway Inc. BRK-B-N (5.5 per cent) and Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. ATD-T (5 per cent).\n\nThe Globe and Mail spoke recently with Mr. O\u2019Kennedy, who oversees about $2.5-billion of his firm\u2019s more-than-$5-billion in AUM, about what he\u2019s been buying and selling, and his advice for new investors.\n\nDescribe your investing style.\n\nWe focus on qualitative components of a business based on our own framework. When evaluating a company, we look at five elements: its industry, competitive position, business model, management team and ESG [environmental, social, and governance] performance. We think of ourselves as owners of businesses and try to identify those that can compound at higher rates over time. We have low turnover and highly concentrated portfolios.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the current market environment?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of speculation in the markets, particularly in sectors such as technology and artificial intelligence (AI). While I believe AI represents a platform shift in technology, and there will be opportunities to invest in this theme, it feels like it has been overextended.\n\nDespite some of the current excitement around AI, many tech stocks are supported by fundamentals. Yes, they\u2019re expensive relative to the market, but they\u2019re also growing faster and have much better competitive positions than other companies. The U.S. market looks expensive, but the expected growth and quality are much better than the rest of the world. In other places, the valuations are more reasonable, but they come with lower quality, growth and cyclicality.\n\nWhat have you been buying?\n\nWe added Kinaxis Inc. KXS-T, the Canadian supply-chain management software company, to our Total Equity Portfolio in January and February. We first bought this in our small-cap fund in 2016.\n\nOften, as these businesses execute and grow, they\u2019ll find their way into our Canadian Equity or Total Equity mandates. We generally like software businesses, especially profitable ones. Its product is a huge upgrade for customers, replacing spreadsheets with an always-on view of the business. It\u2019s a leader in this space and growing rapidly.\n\nKinaxis recently launched a quicker-to-implement version of its product, which has helped it open up to the small- and medium-sized business market. It\u2019s a well-run business with high-margin, recurring revenue from its software-as-a-service product. It\u2019s an interesting business that we think can grow significantly.\n\nWe\u2019ve also been buying Ametek Inc. AME-N, a Depew, N.Y.-based company that manufactures electronic appliances and electromechanical devices. Its products are used in the manufacturing of various components in the aerospace, defence, medical and industrial markets. Ametek creates value through acquisitions. It has a strong management team that\u2019s focused on deploying capital effectively.\n\nWhat have you been selling?\n\nOracle Corp. ORCL-N, the software and cloud computing giant, is a company we sold recently. We\u2019ve owned it for more than a decade. We did okay with it. It hasn\u2019t been one of our better performers. While it\u2019s a very good business, we think it\u2019s a bit overvalued. The overall business isn\u2019t growing that fast, and its core database business is under threat from many competitors.\n\nWe also sold Thomson Reuters Corp. TRI-T. The company has undergone an incredible transformation since the sale of its financial and risk business in 2018. However, we see limited upside from here.\n\nName a stock you wish you bought or didn\u2019t sell.\n\nConstellation Software Inc. CSU-T is a stock I wish I had bought. It\u2019s our type of business, and I\u2019ve followed it for a long time. We own it in our Canadian Equity Portfolio, but I regret not owning it in our Total Equity Portfolio. We review it continuously; however, at these levels, near-term returns could be challenging for the stock.\n\nWhat advice do you have for new investors?\n\nKeep your fees low and take advantage of all the registered programs such as the tax-free savings account, registered retirement savings [plan] and, if you\u2019re looking to buy your first home, the new first-home savings account. Also, people who work with financial planners tend to have better outcomes over time, but again, watch the fees.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nFor more from Globe Advisor, visit our homepage."

            "article_text": "What are we looking for?\n\nAs the COP26 UN climate conference continues, expect new governmental pledges to improve environmental sustainability. New actions or regulations could hurt industries such as oil and gas, while boosting incentives for others such as electric vehicle manufacturers and clean energy producers. Companies behind the curve on environmental sustainability could be affected by policy mandates that might increase costs and reduce profits. As a result, we decided to screen for Canadian companies with positive environmental news momentum in the past 12 months.\n\nThe screen\n\nTo begin our analysis, we used FactSet\u2019s Universal Screening tool to pull all publicly traded securities on the Toronto Stock Exchange with a market capitalization greater than $100-million.\n\nNext, we analyzed sustainability scores calculated by FactSet Truvalue Labs, an artificial intelligence-driven leader in providing environmental, social and governance data. Truvalue Labs uses a proprietary algorithm to calculate ESG scores using data sourced from news articles, non-governmental organizations, trade blogs, social media and more. To ensure data quality, we only included companies that have at least 50 data points available in the past 12 months for each company analyzed.\n\nEach of the 88 companies that passed our screen were then ranked from best to worst on six different environmental scores, as defined by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, shown in the accompanying table. Finally, an average of each individual ranking was taken to create a composite rank.\n\nMore about FactSet\n\nFactSet is a leading global financial data and technology company. FactSet\u2019s superior suite of content, analytics and workflow solutions covers the entire portfolio life cycle and offers actionable insights for asset managers and investment professionals around the world.\n\nWhat we found\n\nTSX-listed companies that score well on ESG metrics relative to peers Company Ticker FactSet Sector Mkt.

Energy is the second-largest sector in Canada, according to FactSet, but none of our top 10 was classified as energy. This makes sense because the Canadian energy space tends to be dominated by oil and gas companies, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and hence were ranked lower. Three utility companies, however, Fortis Inc., Boralex Inc. and Northland Power Inc., made the list. All three are involved, to varying degrees, in generating renewable energy, which may explain their high rank.\n\nInterestingly, Iamgold Corp. was the only non-energy materials company to pass our screen. Despite being a precious metals producer, Iamgold committed to achieving net negative GHG emissions by 2050 recently, which was received positively by the broader public. Additionally, it scored exceptionally well on ecological impacts, ranking at No. 7. Truvalue Lab\u2019s rankings factor in how a company fared relative to its industry, and Iamgold seems to be moving faster than its peers in the mining space.\n\nTelus Inc., the second-largest telecommunications company in Canada by market capitalization, tied for seventh on our screen, with a particularly high rank on water and wastewater management. A telecom provider may not come to mind when thinking of wastewater, however, Telus recently launched a new social impact fund that included a key partnership with a wastewater treatment company. Moreover, income seekers may be interested in Telus\u2019s dividend yield of 4.3 per cent. The payout will continue to grow, at an annualized rate of 7 per cent over the next three years, according to analyst consensus estimates.\n\nThe information in this article is not investment advice.
