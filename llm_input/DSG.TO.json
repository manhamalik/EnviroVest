The increasing complexity and global nature of value chains makes it challenging for companies to get reliable information on business partners\u2019 operations. The fragmentation of national rules on corporate, sustainability-related due diligence obligations further slows down the take-up of good practices. Stand-alone measures by some Member States are not enough to help companies exploit their full potential and act sustainably.\n\nEU rules will provide a uniform legal framework and ensure a level playing field for companies across the EU Single Market. Such rules will also foster international competitiveness, increase innovation and ensure legal certainty for companies addressing sustainability impacts.

            "article_text": "Corporate boards have been seeing a declining focus on ESG issues, with slightly less than half including ESG as part of their regular agenda, as most directors report ambiguity into the meaning of ESG, many viewing it as a charged term, and less than one in ten agreeing that ESG means the same thing as sustainability, according to the new U.S.-focused Annual Corporate Directors Survey released by global professional services firm PwC.\n\nFor the report, PwC surveyed more than 520 directors at U.S. public companies, across a wide range of industries, including 69% serving on boards of companies with greater than $1 billion in revenue, and 58% who have served on their boards for more than 5 years.\n\nThe survey found a decline in boardroom focus on ESG, with only around half (47%) of respondents reporting that ESG issues are regularly part of the board\u2019s agenda, down from 52% last year and from 55% in 2022, although notably still well above 34% reported by directors in 2019. Additionally, while over half (55%) report that ESG issues are part of the board\u2019s enterprise risk management discussions, this has also declined from 59% last year.\n\nAccording to PwC, the decreasing focus comes amidst challenges associated with ESG, including \u201cthe ambiguity that surrounds it,\u201d and the \u201cincreasingly complex and fraught\u201d environment surrounding ESG issues. The survey found, for example, that 66% of directors agreed that \u201cESG means different things to different people,\u201d and more than a third agreed that \u201cESG has become a charged term and is no longer valuable.\u201d\n\nNotably, only 7% of directors agreed that \u201cESG means the same thing as sustainability.\u201d\n\nThe survey also indicated a lack of understanding of ESG at the board level, with only 42% of respondents reporting that they believe that ESG is consistently understood by the directors on their boards. This was particularly apparent among boards at smaller companies, with only 36% saying that directors consistently understood ESG, compared with 52% on the boards of large companies. Larger companies were also more than twice as likely to see a link between ESG and company performance, with 32% of directors at these companies saying that ESG has a direct impact on the bottom line, compared with only 15% of directors at smaller companies.\n\nThe lack of understanding on ESG issues comes, however, as companies face challenges and decisions regarding many of these topics. The report found, for example, that only 57% of respondents said that their boards are sufficiently prepared to oversee upcoming mandatory ESG disclosures, and only 56% reported knowing how their companies\u2019 climate commitments will impact capital allocation decisions.\n\nIn the report, PwC said:\n\n\u201cTo effectively oversee all that ESG involves, directors need to move beyond the terminology and understand management\u2019s process for identifying the organization\u2019s most important risks and how they may evolve over time. Whether the company elects to call it ESG or sustainability, identifying the issues that credibly drive sustainable value creation involves expanding the lens when developing long-term strategic plans, identifying and mitigating material risks, and recognizing emerging growth opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe report also examined the ESG-related issues that are currently receiving the most boardroom attention, with more than half of respondents reporting that data security and talent management have each been discussed by the board at every meeting, and 95% reporting discussing these at least once over the past year, followed by carbon emissions, discussed at least once by 67% of boards over the past year, climate change by 60%, and enhanced voluntary disclosure by 52%.\n\nPwC added:\n\n\u201cDirectors play a crucial role in guiding management to allocate resources and attention to sustainability issues. Forward-looking companies recognize the connection between committing resources to sustainability initiatives and achieving long-term success. Boards need to discern which topics have a direct impact on near-term performance or capital allocation decisions and which require monitoring without necessitating direct input.\u201d\n\nClick here to access the survey."

            "article_text": "This study explores the impact of ESG ratings on corporate performance, focusing on achieving sustainable development and corporate sustainability through innovation within the context of high-quality global economic growth. In recent years, ESG ratings have garnered significant attention in the financial sector, influencing corporate strategy and performance management. While some argue that ESG activities might detract from profitability, others highlight that firms with strong ESG performance can access low-cost capital, thereby enhancing overall performance. Using a sample of China\u2019s A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2021, this research examines the influence and mechanisms of ESG ratings on corporate performance. The findings indicate a significant positive relationship between ESG ratings and corporate performance, which remains robust after rigorous testing. Mediation analysis reveals that ESG ratings improve corporate performance by alleviating financing constraints and enhancing corporate reputation. Furthermore, the performance-enhancing effects of ESG ratings are more pronounced in firms with robust internal controls and private enterprises. This research provides empirical evidence to support stronger ESG investment and the refinement of the ESG rating system.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nUnder the guidance of high-quality global economic development, how to achieve sustainable development at the corporate level and achieve corporate sustainability based on innovation has become an important topic of concern in academia in recent years (Lozano, 2015; Guo et al., 2024a). In recent years, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors have increasingly become essential considerations in corporate operations and investment decisions (Friede et al., 2015). ESG ratings, as a comprehensive assessment method, aim to measure a company\u2019s performance in environmental, social, and governance domains, offering investors and stakeholders a more holistic view of corporate sustainability (Kotsantonis et al., 2016). With the growing societal awareness of corporate social responsibility and environmental consciousness, ESG ratings have garnered widespread attention in the financial sector, playing an increasingly pivotal role in corporate strategy and performance management (Giese et al., 2019). For instance, in the investor decision-making process for businesses, ESG has reshaped the investment philosophies of institutional investors (Clark et al., 2015). Gradually, ESG factors are incorporated into investment decision analyses and behaviors. Institutional investors are more inclined to focus on companies with standout ESG performances (Li et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2024). Additionally, ESG advantages can significantly and robustly enhance the likelihood and scale of listed companies\u2019 foreign investments, positively impacting international direct investment (Xie and Lu, 2022). As the importance of ESG grows, an increasing amount of capital flows into ESG-related areas, indicating a long-term trend that compels companies to strengthen their ESG foundations (Hu et al., 2023). In Western markets, ESG investment has become mainstream. According to the official website of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, since the introduction of the \u201cPrinciples for Responsible Investment (PRI)\u201d in 2006, the number of signatories has increased from 734 in 2010 to 1,384 in 2015 and 5,022 in June 2022, with the signatories managing assets that account for over 50% of the global professional asset management scale.\n\nAs the integration of ESG principles into corporate development strategies and operational management gradually strengthens, scholars have conducted extensive theoretical and empirical research on ESG (Tarmuji et al., 2016). Numerous studies have found that good ESG performance helps reduce the cost of equity capital (El Ghoul et al., 2011), debt costs (Goss and Roberts, 2011), alleviates financing constraints (Qiu and Yin, 2019), and assists companies in risk avoidance (Albuquerque et al., 2019). However, the research on the impact of ESG performance on corporate performance has not yet reached a unified conclusion. Most studies have found a positive correlation between ESG ratings and corporate financial performance. Chen et al. (2023), based on data from 3,332 listed companies from 2011 to 2020, found a significant positive correlation between ESG ratings and corporate performance. Wang et al. (2023) also confirmed that a 1% increase in ESG ratings would improve the performance of manufacturing enterprises by 0.124%. Zeng and Jiang (2023) analyzed Chinese agricultural and forestry listed companies and found that ESG ratings have a significant positive impact on corporate performance.\n\nSome studies have compared the impacts of the three dimensions of ESG. Zeng and Jiang (2023) found that social and governance performance have a more substantial effect on improving corporate performance. Baek and Lee (2024) discovered that environmental and social performance can enhance corporate performance, but the impact of governance performance is not significant. Wang and Yang (2023) revealed that environmental, social, and governance performance all help reduce corporate credit risk. Additionally, Yang et al. (2024) pointed out that the impacts of the three dimensions of ESG exhibit a phased nature.\n\nSome research indicates a non-linear relationship between ESG ratings and corporate performance. Yang et al. (2024), based on the corporate life cycle theory, found that the impact of ESG on corporate performance is strongest during the growth stage but may become negative during the decline stage. Gao et al. (2023) also confirmed that there is a U-shaped relationship between ESG ratings and corporate performance. When ESG ratings are low, companies tend to focus on their operational conditions, neglecting long-term investments such as green innovation, leading to a decline in performance. However, when ESG ratings reach a certain level, companies start to emphasize sustainable development, resulting in improved performance.\n\nExisting literature has also explored the moderating factors in the relationship between ESG ratings and corporate performance. On the one hand, the positive impact of ESG ratings on performance is more pronounced for companies that are highly polluting, state-owned, or located in eastern regions (Wang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). On the other hand, the higher the quality of ESG information disclosure and the greater the analyst attention, the more significant the impact of ESG ratings on corporate performance (Cao et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023). Additionally, Jin et al. (2023) found that ESG ratings help mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on the performance of tourism companies.\n\nPrevious research has provided valuable insights into the relationship between ESG ratings and corporate performance. However, there are still some academic divisions in understanding this relationship, and many studies have not deeply examined the specific mechanisms through which ESG ratings affect corporate performance, leading to gaps in the logical chain. Future research could further explore the differences in the impact of ESG ratings across various industries and ownership structures, as well as the determinants of ESG information disclosure quality.\n\nConsidering the above, this paper embarks from the perspective of ESG as an informal environmental regulation. Using the sample of A-share listed companies in China from 2009 to 2021, it empirically investigates the impact of ESG ratings on corporate performance and its underlying mechanisms. The main contributions of this study are threefold. First, it enriches research on the economic consequences of corporate ESG. By focusing on their ESG performance, companies not only contribute to environmental protection and governance but also foster their own value, promoting their long-term development. Second, it enhances the literature in the domain of corporate performance. While past studies have explored the relationship between ESG ratings and corporate performance without arriving at a consistent conclusion (Li et al., 2018), this paper\u2019s findings deepen the understanding of the relationship between the two. Lastly, it advances the study on the specific mechanisms through which ESG ratings impact corporate performance, deepening the research methodology on how ESG ratings influence corporate outcomes. Empirically, using a comprehensive dataset of listed companies, this study provides solid evidence on the effect of ESG ratings on corporate performance and its causal pathways. Moreover, it extends research on the heterogeneity of companies\u2019 fulfillment of ESG responsibilities. The conclusions of this study highlight the significance of ESG ratings on corporate performance, offering empirical evidence that could guide relevant departments to further enhance ESG investments and refine ESG rating systems. Such insights will assist in steering companies towards a more sustainable and responsible direction, fostering sustainable growth and prosperity in the global economy.\n\n2 Theoretical analysis and research hypothesis\n\n2.1 The impact of ESG rating on firm performance\n\nThe ESG rating represents a company\u2019s performance in three aspects: environmental, social, and corporate governance (Junius et al., 2020). In recent years, ESG factors have evolved from purely moral and ethical considerations to significant factors influencing long-term business performance. As global attention to sustainability issues increases, investors, consumers, and regulators are placing increasing emphasis on corporate ESG performance, making it crucial to understand how ESG ratings impact business performance (Yu and Xiao, 2022).\n\nFirstly, environmental factors are one of the key considerations in ESG ratings, and there is a positive correlation between a company\u2019s environmental management and performance and its financial performance. When companies adopt more environmentally friendly strategies, they often reduce risks associated with environmental compliance (Guo et al., 2024c) and benefit from more efficient resource management, thereby enhancing profitability (Horv\u00e1thov\u00e1, 2010). A company that places a high emphasis on the environment may lead in energy efficiency, resource utilization, and innovative product development, thus reducing costs and increasing revenues (Friede et al., 2015). Furthermore, they can avoid fines and litigations due to non-compliance, thereby bolstering confidence among shareholders and investors (Gao et al., 2023).\n\nSecondly, social factors are also a critical consideration in ESG ratings. Social performance involves employee relations, customer satisfaction, and supply chain management. The way a company treats its employees often directly impacts employee loyalty and productivity, thus affecting the company\u2019s long-term performance (Huang and Qiu, 2023). For instance, treating employees well can increase their satisfaction and productivity, thereby reducing employee turnover and recruitment costs (Edmans, 2011). Moreover, establishing healthy relationships with suppliers and communities can lead to better supply chain stability and market reputation, and strong customer relationships and supply chain management can offer a competitive edge, improving market share and profitability (Espinosa-M\u00e9ndez et al., 2023).\n\nLastly, ESG ratings require companies to have sound governance structures and transparency. Effective corporate governance mechanisms can enhance decision-making efficiency, leading to better financial performance. There is often a positive relationship between the quality of corporate governance and business performance (Gompers et al., 2003). For instance, an independent board, clear governance guidelines, and transparent financial reporting are all associated with high business performance (Bebchuk et al., 2013). Transparent and fair decision-making processes can not only boost the confidence of internal staff but also attract external investment, creating more growth opportunities for the company (Carnini Pulino et al., 2022).\n\nFrom the perspective of Schumpeter\u2019s innovation theory and stakeholder theory, when companies proactively fulfill their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) responsibilities, it signifies that these firms are breaking through and innovating beyond traditional development models. They are no longer solely pursuing economic growth. By acting in this manner, companies send trustworthy signals to their stakeholders, potentially reducing transaction costs between the enterprise and its stakeholders and enhancing the firm\u2019s value (Freeman and Evan, 1990).\n\nIn general, there is a positive correlation between good ESG ratings and high business performance. This suggests that prioritizing ESG factors is not just a matter of ethics and morality but also pertains to a company\u2019s profitability and competitive edge. Based on this, the following research hypothesis, H1, is proposed:\n\nH1. ESG ratings have a positive impact on business performance.\n\n2.2 ESG rating, financing constraints and firm performance\n\nFinancing constraints are difficulties and limitations that enterprises face when obtaining external financing, typically caused by information asymmetry and market imperfections (Song and Deng, 2023). The impact of financing constraints on corporate performance is significant and multifaceted. Firstly, financing constraints limit investment opportunities, preventing firms from fully capitalizing on favorable investment projects, particularly those requiring substantial capital investment, thus potentially causing missed growth opportunities due to insufficient funds (Yu, 2023). Secondly, financing constraints increase financial costs, as firms need to pay higher interest rates or provide more collateral to secure funds, directly impacting profit margins (Hu, 2023). Additionally, financing constraints lead to more conservative business decisions, reducing investment in R&D and market expansion, thereby affecting long-term competitiveness and innovation capabilities (Tang, 2022).\n\nESG ratings alleviate financing constraints through various channels, thereby enhancing corporate performance. Firstly, a good ESG rating can improve market image and boost the confidence of investors and financial institutions, making it easier for firms to obtain financing in capital markets (Wu, 2023). As investors increasingly emphasize sustainable development performance, firms with high ESG ratings, perceived as lower risk and having better long-term returns, attract more investors and lower-cost capital (Song and Deng, 2023). Secondly, excellent ESG performance reduces information asymmetry, thereby lowering financing costs (Zhou et al., 2022). Comprehensive and transparent ESG information disclosure helps investors and financial institutions better understand the firm\u2019s operational status, reducing the risk premium caused by information asymmetry (Liu, 2023). Additionally, firms with high ESG ratings typically possess better corporate governance structures and risk management capabilities, making financial institutions more optimistic in their credit risk assessments and more willing to offer favorable financing conditions (Yu, 2023). Lastly, ESG ratings improve internal control mechanisms and enhance financial health, thereby alleviating financing constraints (Tang, 2022). Firms with high ESG ratings operate more efficiently and are financially more robust, enhancing their bargaining power in financing negotiations and reducing default risk (Zhang and Liu, 2022).\n\nIn summary, this paper proposes the following research hypothesis H2:\n\nH2. ESG ratings can alleviate financing constraints and thereby improve corporate performance.\n\n2.3 ESG rating, corporate reputation and firm performance\n\nCorporate reputation refers to the comprehensive evaluation of a company\u2019s overall image and behavior by the public, customers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders (Belayeva et al., 2021). A good corporate reputation has a significant impact on corporate performance. Firstly, corporate reputation can enhance customer loyalty and attract new customers, thereby increasing sales revenue and market share (Liu, 2022). Customers are more willing to purchase and support products and services from companies with a good reputation because they believe these companies can provide high-quality products and excellent services (Kim and Li, 2021). Secondly, a good corporate reputation helps attract and retain talented employees. Employees are more willing to work for companies with a good reputation, which not only increases their job motivation and productivity but also reduces the costs of recruitment and training (Huang and Qiu, 2023). Additionally, corporate reputation can boost investor and financial institution confidence, making it easier for companies to obtain financing in capital markets, thereby reducing financing costs and improving financial performance (Zhan, 2023).\n\nESG ratings can enhance corporate reputation in several ways, thereby promoting improved corporate performance. Firstly, good ESG performance can highlight a company\u2019s efforts and achievements in environmental protection, social responsibility, and corporate governance, helping to establish a positive image among the public and stakeholders (Chen and Shen, 2022). Consumers and investors increasingly value sustainable development performance, and companies with high ESG ratings are perceived as more responsible and reliable, making it easier to gain public trust and support (Gao et al., 2023). Secondly, companies with high ESG ratings are typically more transparent in information disclosure, able to convey ESG information accurately and promptly to stakeholders, reducing information asymmetry and enhancing corporate credibility and transparency (Odriozola and Baraibar-Diez, 2017). Furthermore, good ESG performance can improve employee satisfaction and loyalty, strengthen internal cohesion and commitment, making employees more willing to contribute to the company\u2019s long-term development (Landi and Sciarelli, 2019). Lastly, companies with high ESG ratings have greater attractiveness and competitiveness in capital markets, attracting more investors and lower-cost capital, further enhancing financial performance and market position (Aouadi and Marsat, 2018).\n\nIn summary, this paper proposes the following research hypothesis H3:\n\nH3. ESG rating can improve corporate performance by enhancing corporate reputation.\n\n3 Data, variables, and estimation strategy\n\n3.1 Estimation strategy\n\nBased on previous studies (Chen et al., 2023), this paper constructs the following model to test the relationship between ESG rating and firm performance, considering that firm and year factors may affect the regression results.\n\nR O A i , t = \u03b1 0 + \u03b1 1 E S G i , t + \u03b4 X + \u03b3 i + \u03c9 t + \u03b5 i , t ( 1 )\n\nIn Formula 1, subscript i is the enterprise and t is the year. ROA represents firm performance, ESG represents ESG ratings, and X represents control variables. For the company fixed effect, for the time fixed effect.\n\nTo further empirically examine whether financing constraints and corporate reputation are the pathways through which ESG ratings affect corporate performance, drawing on the research of Guo et al. (2024b), this paper establishes the following mediation effect model:\n\nR O A i , t = \u03b1 0 + \u03b1 1 E S G i , t + \u03b4 X + \u03b3 i + \u03c9 t + \u03b5 i , t ( 2 )\n\nm i d d l e i , t = \u03b1 0 + \u03b1 1 E S G i , t + \u03b4 X + \u03b3 i + \u03c9 t + \u03b5 i , t ( 3 )\n\nR O A i , t = \u03b1 0 + \u03b2 1 E S G i , t + \u03b1 2 m i d d l e i , t + \u03b4 X + \u03b3 i + \u03c9 t + \u03b5 i , t ( 4 )\n\nFormula 2 is the same as Formula 1. In Formula 3, 4, the middle term refers to the mediating variables such as financing constraints (KZ) and corporate reputation (Rep).\n\n3.2 Variable selection\n\n3.2.1 Dependent variable\n\nThe dependent variable in this study is firm performance (ROA). Generally, scholars tend to use metrics such as return on assets and net profit margin from sales to measure it. Drawing upon the research of Wang et al. (2022), this paper employs the total asset return rate to gauge firm performance. Additionally, for robustness, this study recalibrates firm performance using the net profit margin from sales in the robustness tests.\n\n3.2.2 Key independent variable\n\nThe core explanatory variable of this paper is the ESG rating (ESG). Drawing from the research of Cai et al. (2023), this study utilizes the annual ESG rating data published by the Wind database, specifically the Huazheng ESG ratings, as the measure for corporate ESG performance. The Huazheng ESG ratings are categorized from highest to lowest as AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C. In this paper, these ratings are assigned values from 9 to 1, respectively, to quantify the ESG performance. A higher score indicates better ESG performance of the company.\n\n3.2.3 Mediating variable\n\nThe mediating variables in this article are financing constraints (KZ) and corporate reputation (Rep). Drawing from the research of Yang and Shen (2020), we adopt the KZ index as the measure for financing constraints. A higher KZ index indicates more severe financing constraints. Moreover, inspired by the studies of Guan and Zhang (2019), this article comprehensively considers the evaluations of various stakeholders regarding corporate reputation. We select 12 evaluation indicators for corporate reputation: company size, market share, level of advertising expenditure, capability for sustainable development, years since listing, beta coefficient, corporate nature, net debt ratio, long-term debt ratio, return on total assets, price-to-book ratio, and Tobin\u2019s Q. We employ factor analysis to compute the reputation score based on these 12 indicators. A higher score implies a better corporate reputation.\n\n3.2.4 Control variables\n\nAccording to the existing literatures, this paper selects factors at the firm level, such as cash-to-assets ratio (con1), fixed assets ratio (con2), board independence (con3), growth rate of operating income (con4), enterprise size (con5), integration of two jobs (con6), as the control variables of the main regression model. To eliminate the influence of heterogeneity factors on firm performance. The main variables selected to perform this study are shown in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1\n\nTable 1. Variable definitions.\n\n3.3 Sample selection and data source\n\nThis paper takes the financial data of China\u2019s A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2021 as research samples to study the impact of ESG rating on corporate performance. Before the empirical analysis, this paper processed the initial data as follows: 1) Remove the delisted and non-operating enterprises, and remove the samples of ST and *ST companies; 2) Excluding financial industry samples; 3) Remove the missing value of the main variable; 4) In order to avoid the influence of extreme values, winsor2 command in Stata17.0 was used to indent all continuous variables at the 1st and 99th percentiles, and 28,773 sample observations were finally obtained. The data in this paper are mainly from Wind and CSMAR databases. Table 2 shows descriptive statistics of the main variables.\n\nTable 2\n\nTable 2. Descriptive statistics.\n\n4 Empirical results\n\n4.1 Regression results\n\nTable 3 presents the benchmark regression results of ESG ratings on firm performance. In column (1), without controlling for firm fixed effects, year fixed effects, and additional control variables, the coefficient of ESG rating is 0.0051, significant at the 1% level. In column (2), after controlling for these factors, the coefficient of ESG rating is 0.0044, also significant at the 1% level. These results indicate a significant positive impact of ESG ratings on firm performance, supporting the hypothesis H1 that ESG ratings can enhance firm performance.\n\nTable 3\n\nTable 3. Benchmark regression.\n\n4.2 Robustness test\n\n4.2.1 Replace the explained variable\n\nDrawing inspiration from the research by Wang and Yang (2022), this study adopts the net sales profitability (ROA2) to re-evaluate corporate performance and conducts a regression again. The regression results are shown in column (1) of Table 4, with the coefficient of ESG at 0.0137, significant at the 1% level. This suggests that ESG ratings can still effectively enhance corporate performance, consistent with the conclusions earlier in the paper, indicating the robustness of our findings.\n\nTable 4\n\nTable 4. Robustness test.\n\n4.2.2 Difference-in-differences (DID) model test\n\nTo better mitigate endogeneity issues, this paper employs a multi-period difference-in-differences model to build a quasi-natural experiment for regression. Drawing from the studies of Hu et al. (2023) and Tan and Zhu (2022), we re-construct the core explanatory variable (ESG_DID) based on the ESG ratings data from Shangdao Ronglu. In 2015, Shangdao Ronglu began evaluating ESG for constituents of the CSI 300 Index and released an ESG rating index. Subsequently, with the increasing disclosure of ESG information by listed companies, more and more companies have been incorporated into Shangdao Ronglu\u2019s ESG rating system, covering 1043 listed companies by 2020. This ESG rating data facilitated the construction of treatment and control groups in the multi-period DID. Specifically, if Shangdao Ronglu releases rating data for company i in year t, it belongs to the treatment group with ESG_DID = 1; otherwise, it's categorized as the control group with ESG_DID = 0. The regression results, as shown in column (2) of Table 4, indicate a coefficient of 0.0030 for ESG_DID, significant at the 5% level. Although the magnitude and significance of the coefficient have decreased slightly, it still shows that ESG ratings can enhance corporate performance, further validating the robustness of the baseline regression conclusions.\n\n4.2.3 GMM regression\n\nTo further effectively mitigate the endogeneity issues in this study, we employ the efficient System GMM method, using the first lag of the ESG rating as an instrumental variable for the ESG rating to conduct the regression again. The regression results are displayed in column (3) of Table 4, with the coefficient of ESG at 0.0051, significant at the 1% level. This result also suggests that ESG ratings can effectively enhance corporate performance. The conclusions of this research still hold.\n\n4.3 Mediation effect analysis\n\n4.3.1 ESG ratings, financing constraints, and corporate performance\n\nWith financing constraints as the mediating variable, a regression was performed on the mediation effect model, and the results are presented in Table 5. The column (2) displays the regression results corresponding to Equation 3. The coefficient of ESG is \u22120.0673, significant at the 1% level. This indicates that ESG ratings can significantly alleviate the financing constraints faced by firms, effectively easing the financial stress of enterprises. Column (3) represents the regression results corresponding to Equation 4, where the coefficient of ESG is 0.0034 and the coefficient of KZ is \u22120.0122; both are significant at the 1% level. It can be observed that ESG ratings have a significant positive impact on corporate performance. Furthermore, ESG ratings can enhance corporate performance by alleviating financing constraints. This validates the research hypothesis H2.\n\nTable 5\n\nTable 5. Mediation effect analysis 1.\n\n4.3.2 ESG ratings, financing constraints, and corporate performance\n\nWith corporate reputation as the mediating variable, a regression was performed on the mediation effect model, and the results are showcased in Table 6. Column (2) presents the regression results corresponding to Equation 3. The coefficient of ESG is 0.0073, significant at the 10% level. This suggests that ESG ratings can notably enhance a company\u2019s reputation, effectively disseminating positive information about the company. Column (3) displays the regression results corresponding to Equation 4, where the coefficient of ESG is 0.0011 and the coefficient of KZ is 0.0468; both are significant at the 1% level. It can be observed that ESG ratings have a significant positive impact on corporate performance. Moreover, ESG ratings can elevate corporate performance by enhancing its reputation. This confirms the research hypothesis H3.\n\nTable 6\n\nTable 6. Mediation effect analysis 2.\n\n4.4 Heterogeneity analysis\n\n4.4.1 ESG rating, internal controls, and corporate performance\n\nInternal control represents a set of systems and processes that enterprises use to ensure compliance, mitigate risks, and enhance governance efficiency. Robust internal control contributes to excellent performance in the ESG domain. For instance, effective internal controls can ensure that enterprises accurately report environmental and social performance, adhering to relevant regulations and standards. Moreover, sound internal control also helps enhance an enterprise\u2019s economic and social performance, facilitating comprehensive business growth and sustainable development (Ioannou and George, 2015). As a result, it is anticipated that robust internal controls can amplify the positive impact of ESG ratings on corporate performance. To verify this hypothesis, drawing from the research by Li et al. (2022a), this paper uses the natural logarithm of the internal control index (incremented by one) from the Debo database to measure the quality of internal controls of listed companies and further conducts a grouped regression. Specifically, companies with an internal control index exceeding the industry average are considered to have robust internal controls, while others are viewed as not having robust controls. The regression results are shown in Table 7. Column (1) presents the regression results for enterprises with robust internal controls, where the coefficient of ESG is 0.0022, significant at the 1% level. Column (2) displays the regression results for enterprises without robust internal controls, where the coefficient of ESG is 0.0010, though not significant. It can be observed that the ESG rating has a more pronounced positive impact on the performance of enterprises with robust internal controls, validating the aforementioned hypothesis.\n\nTable 7\n\nTable 7. Applicability analysis.\n\n4.4.2 ESG rating, property rights, and corporate performance\n\nUnder different ownership structures, corporate governance and business decisions are influenced to varying extents. For instance, privately-owned enterprises usually place more emphasis on market-oriented operations and the pursuit of short-term profits, while state-owned enterprises might be more influenced by government policies and social responsibilities, paying less attention to corporate performance (Megginson and Netter, 2001). Therefore, it is expected that in state-owned enterprises, the positive effect of ESG ratings on corporate performance may no longer be evident. To validate this hypothesis, the overall sample was divided into state-owned and privately-owned enterprise samples for grouped regression analysis. The regression results are shown in Table 7. Column (3) presents the regression results for state-owned enterprises, where the coefficient of ESG is \u22120.0001, though not significant. Column (4) displays the regression results for privately-owned enterprises, where the coefficient of ESG is 0.0058, significant at the 1% level. It can be observed that the ESG rating has a more pronounced positive impact on the performance of privately-owned enterprises, validating the aforementioned hypothesis.\n\n5 Discussion\n\nThe results of this study indicate a significant positive correlation between ESG ratings and the performance of Chinese A-share listed companies. This finding is consistent with previous research (Yu and Xiao, 2022). Specifically, companies with high ESG ratings exhibit superior financial performance and market competitiveness. Empirical analysis reveals that ESG ratings enhance corporate performance by improving corporate reputation and optimizing financing conditions. Firstly, good ESG ratings help elevate a company\u2019s reputation among investors and consumers, thereby attracting more investments and increasing market share. Secondly, superior ESG performance enables companies to secure financing at lower costs, reducing financial risks. Moreover, our study reveals that ESG ratings have a more pronounced impact on the performance of companies with strong internal controls and private enterprises, indicating that robust internal control mechanisms effectively promote adherence to ESG principles, thereby enhancing overall corporate performance.\n\nThe benchmark regression analysis uncovers the direct impact of ESG ratings on corporate performance, carrying significant implications. Firstly, it demonstrates that focusing on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors alongside financial goals can yield substantial financial returns. This finding supports the stakeholder theory, which posits that by addressing the needs of various stakeholders, companies can achieve better financial performance (Zhu et al., 2023). Secondly, this result underscores the critical role of policymakers and regulatory bodies in promoting corporate sustainability. By establishing and implementing effective ESG standards and policies, they can encourage companies to enhance their ESG performance, creating a win-win situation (Li et al., 2022b). Furthermore, the findings from the benchmark regression analysis offer valuable insights for investors. Companies with high ESG ratings not only possess stronger market competitiveness and lower financing costs but also provide more stable returns for investors (Wu et al., 2022).\n\nThe findings of the mechanism examination reveal the intrinsic mechanisms through which ESG ratings impact corporate performance, underscoring their profound significance. Firstly, research indicates that ESG ratings enhance corporate performance by improving corporate reputation (Gao et al., 2023). A good corporate reputation not only strengthens the trust of customers and investors but also attracts high-quality employees, boosting their loyalty and work enthusiasm, thereby enhancing overall corporate efficiency and innovation capacity (Huang and Qiu, 2023). This further suggests that in the process of improving ESG ratings, companies should emphasize transparency and information disclosure, enabling stakeholders to fully understand their efforts and achievements in environmental, social, and governance areas (Albitar et al., 2020). Secondly, the mechanism examination results show that ESG ratings improve corporate performance by optimizing financing conditions (Song and Deng, 2023). Specifically, companies with high ESG ratings are typically able to secure financing at lower costs, primarily because these companies are viewed as lower-risk and more stable (Hou, 2023). The reduction in financing costs not only helps alleviate financial pressure and increase profit margins but also provides more capital to support corporate development and expansion (Zou, 2023). This finding holds significant implications for corporate management and financial institutions; corporate management should actively promote ESG practices to secure more favorable financing conditions, while financial institutions should emphasize ESG performance as a key indicator in assessing corporate credit risk (Michalski and Low, 2021). However, we must interpret these results with caution. Firstly, these mechanisms may exhibit different effects across various types of enterprises and industries. For instance, in certain high-risk industries, the impact of ESG ratings on financing costs may not be as significant as in other industries (Bin-Feng et al., 2024). Secondly, enterprises of different scales and structures may face distinct challenges and opportunities when implementing ESG strategies (Chen and Shen, 2022). Therefore, future research should further explore the applicability and effectiveness of these mechanisms in different contexts. Overall, the mechanism examination results of this study provide new perspectives for understanding how ESG ratings influence corporate performance, while also offering practical guidance for companies in formulating and implementing ESG strategies (Gao, 2023). Nevertheless, to comprehensively verify the universality and robustness of these mechanisms, more empirical research and cross-industry comparative analyses are needed to ensure that our conclusions hold in a broader context (Liu, 2023).\n\nThe findings from the heterogeneity analysis reveal the differential impact of ESG ratings on the performance of various types of firms, highlighting profound implications. Firstly, research indicates that ESG ratings have a more significant impact on the performance of companies with strong internal controls and private enterprises. For companies with robust internal control mechanisms, the implementation of ESG practices is more standardized and effective, allowing these firms to better adhere to ESG guidelines and thereby enhance overall performance (Yu and Xiao, 2022). This finding emphasizes the critical role of internal control in achieving corporate sustainability goals and suggests that companies should focus on building and improving their internal control mechanisms when formulating and implementing ESG strategies (Liu, 2023). Secondly, private enterprises demonstrate greater flexibility and efficiency in adopting and implementing ESG strategies, making the positive impact of ESG ratings on their performance more pronounced. Private enterprises typically have faster decision-making processes and higher execution capabilities, enabling them to swiftly respond to market demands and environmental changes, effectively implement ESG strategies, and achieve corresponding performance improvements (Billio et al., 2021). This result provides important insights for the management of private enterprises, indicating that enhancing ESG practices not only helps improve corporate social responsibility and market image but also brings substantial financial returns (Limkriangkrai et al., 2017).\n\nThe results further underscore the pivotal role of ESG ratings in contemporary corporate management and strategic decision-making. ESG ratings are not only crucial indicators of corporate sustainability but also key factors in assessing long-term success and market competitiveness. This is particularly relevant in today\u2019s economic environment, where businesses face increasing challenges in social responsibility and environmental sustainability. The study indicates that companies effectively integrating ESG standards into their business strategies are more likely to achieve long-term financial and market success. This not only guides corporate management in formulating long-term strategies but also provides valuable indicators for investors to assess a company\u2019s potential. Hence, businesses should place greater emphasis on ESG ratings as essential tools for enhancing corporate value and social responsibility.\n\n6 Conclusion\n\n6.1 Conclusion\n\nIn recent years, with the rise of the high-quality development orientation of the global economy, the focus on sustainable development and innovation at the corporate level has become a research hotspot in academia. ESG ratings, as a comprehensive evaluation method, aim to measure a company\u2019s performance in the fields of environment, social, and governance, offering investors and stakeholders a more comprehensive view of corporate sustainability. Through empirical research on Chinese A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2021, this study finds that ESG ratings have a positive impact on corporate performance, a conclusion that remains valid after robustness checks. Good ESG performance can not only reduce the cost of equity capital, debt costs, and financing difficulties but also helps enterprises avoid risks. Although past research on the impact of ESG performance on corporate performance has been divided, the results of this study support the positive role of ESG in enhancing corporate performance. In the analysis of the impact mechanism, this article found that ESG ratings could promote an improvement in corporate performance by alleviating financing constraints and enhancing corporate reputation. By focusing on ESG performance, enterprises not only strengthen their financing capabilities but also earn a good reputation, thereby achieving a higher return on investment and performance level. Furthermore, the study also found that the performance-enhancing effect of ESG ratings is more pronounced for companies with robust internal controls and private enterprises.\n\n6.2 Policy suggestion\n\nBased on the findings of this study, we propose the following policy recommendations to further promote corporate practices in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, thereby enhancing overall performance. Firstly, governments and regulatory agencies should establish stricter and clearer ESG standards, develop unified assessment standards and indicator systems, and set corresponding compliance requirements for different types and sizes of enterprises. These standards should be regularly reviewed and updated to adapt to market and environmental changes. Implementing mandatory policies and regulations can compel companies to prioritize ESG performance, thereby improving their market competitiveness and financial performance.\n\nSecondly, enhancing the transparency and accuracy of ESG information disclosure is crucial. Regulatory agencies should require companies to regularly disclose their performance in environmental, social, and governance areas, providing standardized disclosure formats and templates to facilitate comparison and evaluation by investors and stakeholders. Additionally, the supervision and auditing of ESG information disclosure should be strengthened to ensure the authenticity and completeness of the information, thereby reducing information asymmetry.\n\nThirdly, encouraging companies to establish robust internal control mechanisms and providing appropriate guidance and support is essential. Governments can develop guidance manuals and training materials to help companies understand and implement effective internal control measures. They can also establish dedicated consulting service agencies to provide customized advice on building internal control systems, ensuring these mechanisms are effectively implemented, thereby enhancing the ESG performance and overall efficiency of companies.\n\nFurthermore, providing ESG investment incentives to reduce corporate investment costs is necessary. Specific measures include offering tax reductions, subsidies, and green loans to companies that meet ESG standards, encouraging investments in environmental protection, social responsibility, and corporate governance. Governments can also establish special funds to support companies in carrying out ESG-related projects and technological innovations, promoting continuous improvement and development in the ESG field.\n\nPromoting ESG education and training is another crucial step. Governments and relevant institutions should regularly organize ESG-themed seminars, training sessions, and promotional activities to help corporate management and employees understand the specific requirements and implementation methods of ESG standards. Collaborations with universities and research institutions can be pursued to develop ESG-related courses and materials, enhancing corporate knowledge and practical abilities in ESG.\n\nFinally, supporting in-depth research and innovation projects on the relationship between ESG and corporate performance is vital. Governments can encourage academic and corporate sectors to explore the best ESG practices by funding research projects and establishing research awards. By promoting scientific research and technological innovation, policymakers can obtain more precise decision-making bases to formulate more effective ESG policies and measures.\n\nThrough these specific policy recommendations, governments and regulatory agencies can effectively promote corporate ESG performance, drive sustainable development, and contribute to high-quality global economic growth and prosperity.\n\n6.3 Limitations and future directions\n\nThis study has several limitations. The sample is confined to companies listed on the Chinese A-share market, which may not fully represent firms in other markets or regions. Additionally, not all potential variables influencing ESG ratings and corporate performance were considered. Although various control variables were included, there may still be unmeasured factors affecting the results. Furthermore, the ESG rating data used in this study were sourced from third-party rating agencies, which may pose issues related to data quality and rating consistency. Different rating agencies may use varying standards and methodologies for ESG evaluation, potentially impacting the findings.\n\nTo address these limitations, future research could validate the findings of this study across different markets and regions to assess the generalizability and external validity of the impact of ESG ratings on corporate performance. Incorporating more potential influencing factors, such as corporate culture, governance structure, and market competition, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms through which ESG ratings affect corporate performance. Additionally, exploring the evaluation standards and methodologies of different rating agencies could enhance the consistency and reliability of ESG data. Conducting longitudinal studies over more extended periods could also reveal the long-term effects of ESG ratings on corporate performance. Furthermore, examining the impact of ESG ratings across various industries and ownership structures would shed light on the unique effects of ESG ratings on different types of firms. Through these efforts, future research will offer more robust theoretical foundations and empirical evidence to support businesses, investors, and policymakers.\n\nData availability statement\n\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nSC: Conceptualization, Formal Analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing\u2013original draft.

            "article_text": "Results and conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that the implementation of ESG systems substantially enhances the financial performance of enterprises within industries characterized by significant environmental impacts. Specifically, investments in environmental protection led to greater resource utilization efficiency, social responsibility initiatives foster enhanced employee productivity and customer loyalty, and strong corporate governance improves management structures and decision-making processes. The case study of Hunan Valin Steel Co., Ltd. reinforces these results, illustrating that a comprehensive ESG framework not only helps such enterprises achieve their environmental and social responsibility objectives but also markedly improves their financial outcomes. This research provides robust empirical evidence and actionable management recommendations for ESG system implementation in environmentally impactful industries, along with scientific support for informed policymaking.\n\nMethods and data: This research integrates empirical analysis with case studies, employing a dataset of 2,376 observations from 792 listed companies within industries with significant environmental impact, spanning the period from 2019 to 2021. The data, sourced from the Wind database, were analyzed using multiple regression techniques. The findings reveal a significant positive relationship between overall ESG scores and corporate performance, measured by Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA). All three ESG dimensions\u2014environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G)\u2014exhibit positive impacts on corporate performance. Furthermore, factors such as company size and growth rate are positively correlated with performance, whereas leverage ratio is negatively correlated. To further substantiate the empirical findings, a case study of Hunan Valin Steel Co., Ltd. was conducted.\n\nResearch background and significance: As China's economy continues its rapid expansion, the issue of environmental degradation has escalated, particularly within industries with significant environmental impact, such as steel, chemical, pharmaceutical sectors. These sectors are confronted with profound environmental and social responsibility challenges. The development of robust Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) systems has therefore become essential for improving environmental performance, meeting social responsibilities, and optimizing corporate governance structures. This study investigates the impact of ESG system implementation on the financial performance of enterprises within these environmentally impactful industries, offering a scientific foundation and practical guidance for corporate leaders and policymakers to facilitate green transformation and sustainable development.\n\n1 Introduction\n\n1.1 Research background and significance\n\nThe economy of China may be considered as one of the fast-growing economies, which has been proving the word for the last few decades (Aldowaish et al., 2022). Yet, the swift economic development is accompanied by unprecedented level of environmental pollution, especially in industrial sectors where their operations have high environmental implications, such as steel, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. Since these sectors consume vast amounts of energy and produce high levels of emissions, they are in the frontline of regulations that set more emission control laws. The issue of environmental conservation as well as corporate social responsibility is increasingly becoming a crucial factor when evaluating companies, and it is no longer entirely about profit margins (Chen et al., 2022; Deng et al., 2024).\n\nThe establishment of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) systems has been acknowledged by companies as a central task of sustaining competition in the market and fulfilling their social responsibility in the context of sustainable development. Such systems are planned to systematically include ESG elements, focusing on potential recycling improvements, risk mitigations, transparency, and the building of technologies that are in sync with SDGs (Oikonomou et al., 2018; Cek and Eyupoglu, 2020).\n\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) concepts have been largely studied, especially in the development of the theory, however, the practical and systemic research, targeting the effect of ESG on company performance in the environmentally hazardous industrial sectors, remains a great research lacuna. The bridge across this gap is essential not only for academia but also for the practical aspect of business.\n\n1.2 Research questions\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) system development on the financial performance of companies operating in industries characterized by significant environmental impact. This research is guided by the following key questions:\n\n\u2022 What is the status and what are the defining characteristics of ESG system construction within these environmentally impactful industries?\n\n\u2022 How do the individual dimensions of ESG\u2014environmental protection, social responsibility, and corporate governance\u2014specifically influence corporate performance?\n\n\u2022 In what ways can companies effectively balance the pursuit of economic benefits with the imperatives of environmental protection and social responsibility during the implementation of ESG systems?\n\n1.3 Research objectives\n\nThrough empirical analysis and case studies focused on industries in China with significant environmental impact, this study aims to achieve the following objectives:\n\n\u2022 To systematically uncover the mechanisms through which ESG system implementation influences corporate financial performance, providing scientific evidence and practical insights for corporate managers. This will facilitate their efforts in achieving green transformation and sustainable development while ensuring continued economic growth.\n\n\u2022 To provide a theoretical framework that supports government policymaking, aimed at enhancing corporate performance in environmentally impactful industries as they meet their social responsibilities, thus contributing to the green and high-quality development of the entire sector.\n\n\u2022 To broaden the theoretical base of existing literature and address the research gap concerning the application of ESG systems within industries characterized by significant environmental impact.\n\n1.4 Introduction summary\n\nThis paper seeks to investigate the impact of ESG system implementation on corporate performance by conducting a comprehensive study of industries in China characterized by significant environmental impact. The research will integrate empirical analysis with case studies to offer fresh insights into the role of ESG systems within these industries. Consequently, the findings are expected to inform effective leadership strategies and provide actionable recommendations for policy improvements.\n\n2 Literature review\n\n2.1 Current research on ESG systems and corporate performance\n\nIn recent years, the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices and corporate performance has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. Globally, a substantial body of literature has emerged since the inception of ESG case studies, with early research primarily focusing on the role of ESG in enhancing corporate performance. Specifically, these studies highlighted how ESG initiatives, particularly in environmental protection, contribute to stakeholder acceptance and improved market performance (Chang and Lee, 2022; Gerard, 2019). Notable early contributions in this field include the works of Hu et al. (2023) and Kluza et al. (2021). However, the current research landscape reflects a more holistic approach to sustainable development, where environmental protection is increasingly integrated with social responsibility and corporate governance, as exemplified by the studies of Gholami et al. (2022) and He et al. (2023).\n\nIn China, ESG research has developed more recently, gaining traction due to the country's unique development trajectory and the environmental challenges it faces. Chinese scholars have predominantly focused on the role of ESG in enhancing corporate transparency, mitigating risks, and increasing competitiveness (Liu and Zhang, 2023; Lokuwaduge and de Silva, 2020).\n\nDespite these advancements, much of the existing research remains confined to individual firms or industries, often concentrating on macroeconomic analyses. This leaves the specific dynamics of ESG system performance within industries characterized by significant environmental impact underexplored. A detailed examination of how these industries implement ESG practices in China remains a critical area for future research.\n\n2.2 Impact of the environmental dimension on corporate performance\n\nEnvironmental responsibility is a core component of ESG, and its impact on corporate performance presents both advantages and challenges (Matakanye et al., 2021). While academic research highlights the benefits that companies can derive from investments in environmental protection, such investments also tend to attract positive attention from customers and investors (Oprean-Stan et al., 2020; Patil et al., 2020). For instance, a study conducted in the United States, utilizing event study data, demonstrated that market movements increased when public firms announced environmental strategies (Popescu et al., 2022). However, it is also observed that environmental investments can elevate overall operational costs, which may not necessarily lead to favorable financial outcomes in the long run. This effect is particularly pronounced in industries in China that have significant environmental impacts, as they require substantial capital investment to comply with stringent state-imposed environmental regulations (Senadheera et al., 2021).\n\nThis paper aims to explore the relationship between ESG factors, and the performance of industries characterized by significant environmental impact. It seeks to identify the unique characteristics of these factors and to determine how companies can balance environmental and financial considerations to make informed and effective investment decisions.\n\n2.3 Impact of the social responsibility dimension on corporate performance\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR), as a critical but often underintegrated aspect of the broader ESG framework, raises important questions regarding its impact on corporate performance. According to several studies, companies that effectively engage in CSR activities can enhance their brand image, attract valuable talent, and reduce financial burdens through cost savings (Teng et al., 2021; Tiefenbacher, 2022). For instance, Teng et al. (2021) found that businesses engaged in socially responsible activities performed well in capital markets, benefiting from access to loans at more favorable interest rates. However, other studies have highlighted that meeting social obligations can also lead to increased transaction costs, particularly during economic downturns, which may impose additional financial pressures on companies (Xie et al., 2019; Yin et al., 2023).\n\nThis study aims to examine how CSR initiatives specifically influence the overall performance of industries in areas characterized by significant environmental impact. It will explore how companies should implement CSR strategies to ensure a positive effect on their financial outcomes.\n\n2.4 Impact of the corporate governance dimension on corporate performance\n\nEffective corporate governance is widely recognized as a critical driver of corporate performance. Research indicates that adherence to sound governance principles significantly enhances financial outcomes (Zhang et al., 2020, 2024). For instance, Alsayegh et al. (2020) demonstrated that achieving a balance among shareholders ultimately contributes to improved corporate performance. Similarly, Baratta et al. (2023) highlighted that transparency in information disclosure, as an aspect of corporate responsibility, is closely linked to a company's reputation and brand value, which in turn positively influences market performance.\n\nThe importance of governance is particularly pronounced in industries with substantial environmental and social responsibilities. In industries characterized by significant environmental impact, corporate governance assumes even greater importance, as these sectors are often under heightened scrutiny to report on their environmental and social responsibilities (Shaikh, 2022). By refining their governance frameworks and enhancing transparency in operations, companies in these industries can better navigate these challenges and achieve superior financial results. This study will provide a detailed analysis of corporate governance and its role in industries with significant environmental impact, examining how governance practices influence corporate performance and outcomes.\n\n2.5 Overall impact of ESG systems on corporate performance\n\nThe existing literature on the overall impact of ESG systems on corporate performance offers three primary perspectives: negative correlation, no significant impact, and positive correlation. Studies that support a negative correlation argue that investments in ESG initiatives require substantial resources, which can reduce investment efficiency, particularly in relation to stock market returns (e.g., Yeaw, 2023). The no-correlation perspective suggests that there is no meaningful relationship between ESG efforts and corporate performance (e.g., Cao et al., 2024). However, the majority of research tends to support the positive correlation viewpoint, positing that investments in ESG can enhance organizational efficiency, lower costs, and ultimately improve corporate performance (e.g., Chen et al., 2023, 2024). This positive correlation is especially pronounced in companies from developed countries, where ESG system implementation has been significantly linked to improved financial performance.\n\nDespite these findings, the specific mechanisms through which ESG systems influence corporate performance in industries characterized by significant environmental impact remain underexplored. This study seeks to address this gap by conducting empirical analysis and case studies to systematically uncover the mechanisms by which ESG system implementation affects corporate performance in these industries. The goal is to provide both theoretical insights and practical guidance for corporate management and policy development.\n\n3 Methods\n\n3.1 Overall framework and methodology\n\nThis study employs a quantitative research approach to investigate the impact of ESG system implementation on the performance of companies within industries characterized by significant environmental impact (Ding et al., 2023). The research framework encompasses the following steps.\n\n3.1.1 Data collection\n\nThe data for this study were sourced from the Wind database, focusing on ESG scores and financial metrics for 792 publicly listed companies in environmentally impactful industries in China, spanning the years 2019 to 2021. The selection criteria included companies that consistently published ESG reports over three consecutive years, with data that were both complete and free of errors.\n\n3.1.2 Data analysis\n\nThe collected data were analyzed using Stata software, employing multiple regression analysis to examine the relationship between the ESG dimensions (environmental, social, governance) and corporate performance indicators (ROE, ROA). Additionally, an event study methodology was utilized to assess the short-term effects of significant ESG-related events on company performance.\n\n3.1.3 Research design\n\nThe conceptual framework guiding this study is illustrated in Figure 1, which delineates the relationship between the independent variables (ESG dimensions: environmental, social, governance) and the dependent variables (ROE, ROA). The specific form of the regression model used in this analysis is as follows:\n\nP e r f o r m a n c e = \u03b1 + \u03b2 1 \u00b7 E S G + \u03b2 2 \u00b7 s i z e + \u03b2 3 \u00b7 l e v e r a g e + \u03b2 4 \u00b7 g r o w t h + \u03b2 5 \u00b7 i n d u s t r y\n\nwhere Performance represents ROE and ROA, ESG represents ESG scores, and Size, Leverage, Growth, Industry, and Year are control variables.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1. EQ7SG score vs. ROA.\n\n3.2 Data collection and processing\n\n3.2.1 Data sources and sample selection\n\nThe data for this study were sourced from the Wind database, focusing on listed companies operating within industries characterized by significant environmental impact in China from 2019 to 2021.\n\n3.2.2 Wind ESG rating overview\n\nThe Wind database is a prominent think-tank in China, providing one of the most widely utilized ESG rating systems. Launched in 2018, Wind ESG Ratings primarily target A-share listed companies, evaluating them across three key dimensions: Environmental (E), mid-Social (mid-S), and Governance (G). These dimensions are assessed through 27 topics and over 300 best practice indicators, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative metrics, which help mitigate biases in the ESG evaluation process.\n\nThe Wind ESG methodology is tailored to reflect China's domestic market conditions and policies. For example, it incorporates local factors such as the presence of high-tech patents and the enterprise's role in poverty alleviation. The ESG scores are ranked on a scale from CCC to AAA, with quarterly updates to capture changes in corporate practices. These ESG metrics are crucial for investors and stakeholders, guiding their decision-making based on the ESG performance of the Chinese companies in which they invest.\n\n3.2.3 Sample selection criteria\n\n\u2022 ESG report consistency: companies included in the sample must have consistently published ESG reports throughout the research period to ensure data consistency and completeness.\n\n\u2022 Data integrity: companies must have clear ESG ratings and associated investment data from the Wind database, with no missing or anomalous data.\n\n3.2.4 Sample description\n\nThe study focuses on four sectors known for generating significant ESG-related risks\u2014chemical manufacturing, steel production, mining, and waste management. These industries are recognized for their substantial environmental impact, including pollution, excessive energy consumption, and waste production.\n\n3.2.5 Distribution of sample companies by industry\n\nTable 1 details the number of companies and their distribution across the major pollutant industries examined in this study.\n\nTable 1\n\nTable 1. Distribution of industries characterized by significant environmental impact companies in the sample.\n\nThis distribution reveals the large portion of chemical manufacturing and steel production companies in our Stanford sample. The study's observation of these two sectors provides insight into the simple and short-term influence of implementing an ESG system on the performance of enterprises with the largest environmental effect.\n\n3.2.6 Variable selection and research design\n\nTo investigate the impact of ESG system implementation on the performance of companies within industries characterized by significant environmental impact, this study identified the following key variables and developed a corresponding empirical analysis model:\n\n3.2.7 Explanatory variables (independent variables)\n\n\u2022 ESG scores (ESG): this includes the overall ESG score as well as the scores for the three individual dimensions: Environmental (E), Social (S), and Governance (G).\n\n3.2.8 Explained variables (dependent variables)\n\n\u2022 Return on equity (ROE): a profitability measure calculated as Net Profit/Shareholders' Equity, reflecting the company's ability to generate profits from shareholders' investments.\n\n\u2022 Return on assets (ROA): a measure of asset utilization efficiency, calculated as Net Profit/Total Assets, indicating how effectively a company uses its assets to generate profits.\n\n3.2.9 Control variables\n\n\u2022 Company size (size): represents the scale of the company, often measured by the natural logarithm of total assets.\n\n\u2022 Leverage ratio (leverage): indicates the proportion of debt in the company's capital structure.\n\n\u2022 Growth potential (growth): measured by the year-over-year growth rate in revenue or earnings.\n\n\u2022 Industry effect (industry): accounts for differences in performance across various industries.\n\n\u2022 Year effect (year): controls for time-specific effects that might influence company performance.\n\n3.3 Empirical analysis methods\n\n3.3.1 Regression analysis and correlation analysis\n\nTo systematically examine the impact of ESG system implementation on the performance of companies within industries characterized by significant environmental impact, the following analytical methods were employed.\n\n3.3.1.1 Correlation analysis\n\nA correlation analysis was initially conducted to explore the relationships between variables (Fu et al., 2023). The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the correlation between the ESG dimension scores (Environmental, Social, Governance) and corporate performance metrics (ROE, ROA).\n\n3.3.1.2 Multiple regression analysis\n\nBuilding on the correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis was performed to test the impact of ESG system implementation on corporate performance (Gu et al., 2023). The OLS approach was employed, and robust standard errors were used with the aim of tackling as much heteroscedasticity as possible. Besides, subgroup regression examination was performed to go in detail on the special effect of each ESG dimension on corporate performance and to check the robustness of the model.\n\n3.3.1.3 Event study method\n\nAdditionally, to validate the influence of ESG system adoption on companies' performance, the event study methodology selected a sample of representative major events for analysis. The specific steps are as follows.\n\n\u2022 Event selection: The Hunan Valin Steel Company was considered a good example to find out the effect of publicizing ESG construction targets and schemes for a big investment conference on corporate influence.\n\n\u2022 Event window: An event window of 10 trading days was found in both cases preceding as well as succeeding the occurrence to view the short-term impact of the happenings on the price of the stock and on the company's performance. The car estimation windows were set for 120 days to 20 days before the event. This was to estimate the car normal return model.\n\n\u2022 Abnormal returns calculation: The abnormal return (AR) and cumulative abnormal return (CAR) were computed within the event window to analyze the short-term effect of interest concerned events on the stock performance.\n\nThrough these analytic approaches, this study is to show how ESG principles implementation affects corporate performance for those sectors that have bigger business environment, thus giving clearer evidence by detailed examples and case studies through it. Data processing and analysis were realized by SPSS and Stata software programs for the results to have both scientific correctness and consistency of them.\n\n3.4 Robustness tests\n\nTo ensure the robustness of the research findings, the following robustness tests were conducted.\n\n3.4.1 Group regression analysis\n\nGroup regression was performed across different company sizes, industry types, and other contextual variables to verify whether the impact of each ESG dimension on corporate performance remains consistent across various contexts (Han et al., 2024).\n\n3.4.2 Alternative variable tests\n\nThe study also introduced alternative variables, such as using net profit margin instead of ROA, to assess the impact of ESG system implementation under different corporate performance indicators, thereby ensuring the robustness of the conclusions (Li et al., 2024).\n\n4 Results\n\n4.1 Analysis of the current state of ESG system construction in industries characterized by significant environmental impact\n\nIn recent years, as China's economy has rapidly developed and environmental concerns have become increasingly prominent, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) system has garnered significant domestic attention. The Chinese government has introduced a series of policies and regulations aimed at encouraging companies to enhance their ESG information disclosure and practices. Notable documents such as the \u201cGuidelines for Environmental Information Disclosure of Listed Companies\u201d and the \u201cGuidelines for Social Responsibility of Listed Companies\u201d have clearly defined companies' obligations and standards concerning environmental protection, social responsibility, and corporate governance. Moreover, domestic ESG rating agencies like SynTao Green Finance, China SIF, the Institute of Finance and Sustainability (IFS), and Wind have progressively established comprehensive ESG evaluation systems, providing crucial references for investors.\n\nIn industries characterized by significant environmental impact, disparities in the construction of ESG systems are evident. According to data from the Wind database, ESG scores of listed companies in these industries generally exhibited an upward trend from 2019 to 2021, though the development across different dimensions was uneven. Specifically, the governance (G) dimension consistently scored higher, reflecting a strong focus on governance structures and transparency. The environmental (E) dimension experienced the most rapid growth, indicating significant investments and advancements in environmental protection. However, the social (S) dimension recorded relatively lower scores, suggesting that companies still have considerable room for improvement in addressing social responsibility.\n\n4.2 Commonalities in ESG system construction in industries characterized by significant environmental impact\n\nThis study examines the commonalities in ESG system development among companies in industries characterized by significant environmental impact, focusing on Porton Pharma Solutions Ltd., SKSHU Paint Co. Ltd., and Shanying International Holdings Co. Ltd., which represent the pharmaceutical manufacturing, chemicals, and papermaking sectors, respectively. These companies play a central role in their respective industries and serve as benchmarks for ESG practices.\n\n4.2.1 Common elements in environmental management execution\n\nEnvironmentally, these corporations have set up systems that offer comprehensive energy consumption and waste management. As an example, Porton Pharma Solutions has developed membrane wastewater treatment systems; SKSHU Paint produces environment-friendly water-based paints; and Shanying International applies state-of-the-art technologies for water conservation and treatment in their paper industry. These activities have led us to see an impressive decline in emissions and energy consumption, and the overall environment pollution. Additionally, these environment protection measures, and their impact are disclosed in a very transparent way, making people get to know that the companies practice ethical behavior, which strengthens the trust of various stakeholders in the companies.\n\n4.2.2 General trends of resilience framework construction\n\nThese industrial enterprises, along with social responsibility, show a strong adherence to the improvement of living and working conditions of their employees and to the development of the communities they operate in. As for the preventive health departments, they have opened them, regularly conducted health check-ups and taught safety training for their workers. Furthermore, not only did they accomplish it, but they also are part of some community programs like building shelters for students and launching projects in healthcare services. For one, Shanying International and SKSHU Paint added to their positive social image by provision of uniforms and school supplies, respectively, to schools and scholarship to qualifying students.\n\n4.2.3 Highlighting corporation stewardship framework commonalities\n\nCorporate governance mechanisms that are based on scientific principles complement these businesses, which means that shareholders and stakeholders receive timely communication. Effective ESG risk management is integral to their governance practices, with specialized risk management committees tasked with identifying and mitigating ESG-related risks. Additionally, these companies have strengthened their internal financial and ESG audit systems and implemented rigorous quality control measures.\n\n4.3 Descriptive statistics of indicators\n\nA summary table of descriptive statistics is provided to facilitate clear interpretation of the key indicators (Table 2). This table includes the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for the ESG scores and financial performance indicators (ROE and ROA) across the 792 companies operating in industries characterized by significant environmental impact.\n\nTable 2\n\nTable 2. Descriptive statistics of key indicators.\n\nThat table has brought to the surface the complete situation about the ESG score and financial performance in the group of companies analyzed. The use of descriptive statistics defines the locality and the complexity range, thus making it easier to understand the subject and the results of the study.\n\n4.4 The impact of ESG system construction on corporate performance in industries characterized by significant environmental impact\n\n4.4.1 Empirical analysis results of ESG system implementation and corporate performance\n\nThis study conducted an empirical analysis of 2,376 samples from 792 listed companies operating in industries characterized by significant environmental impact between 2019 and 2021 to investigate the impact of ESG system implementation on corporate performance. Multiple regression analysis was employed to analyze the data, and the key findings are as follows.\n\n4.4.2 Overall regression results\n\nThe results indicate a significant positive relationship between comprehensive ESG scores and corporate performance, as measured by ROE and ROA (Table 3). This suggests that the implementation of ESG systems may lead to a substantial improvement in financial performance for companies within these industries.\n\nTable 3\n\nTable 3. Results of regression analysis of ESG composite score on firm performance.\n\nThe efforts of industries characterized by significant environmental impact have shown a positive effect on overall corporate performance, as indicated by improvements in ROE and ROA. These findings suggest that the implementation of ESG systems can enhance investment outcomes (Figure 1). Additionally, company size and growth positively contribute to corporate development, whereas the leverage ratio has a negative impact on corporate performance.\n\nFigure 1 shows the relationship between the ESG score and ROA, further supporting the empirical evidence of a positive correlation between comprehensive ESG efforts and corporate profitability.\n\nTo accurately assess the individual impact of each pillar of the ESG system on corporate performance, this study applies regression techniques focused on the Environmental (E) dimension, as well as the Social (S) and Governance (G) dimensions (Table 4).\n\nTable 4\n\nTable 4. Outcome of the regression analysis of the social aspects on the business performance.\n\nTable 4 presents the regression analysis results for the environmental dimension, revealing a significant positive impact on both ROE and ROA (*p < 0.01). These findings suggest that increased investment in environmental protection by companies within industries characterized by significant environmental impact strongly contributes to enhanced financial performance.\n\nThe influence of the social dimension (S) (Table 5) on business performance is detailed in Table 5.\n\nTable 5\n\nTable 5. Social dimensions and their relationships with ROE and ROA revealed by regression analysis.\n\nTable 5 illustrates the positive correlation between the social responsibility score and financial performance. The findings indicate that increased investments in environmental protection and corporate social responsibility directly contribute to improved financial performance. The table also explicitly notes the statistical significance and observed trends to ensure clarity in interpretation.\n\nThe influence of the governance dimension (G) (Table 6) on corporate performance is presented in Table 6.\n\nTable 6\n\nTable 6. Determinants of governance on corporate performance as per the regression analysis.\n\nThe results of the regression analysis on the governance dimension (G) reveal a highly significant positive relationship with both ROE and ROA. These findings underscore the importance of corporate governance structures and practices in enhancing an organization's financial performance.\n\nThe descriptive statistics of the key performance indicators display a wide range of values, reflecting the diverse environmental impacts and governance structures across the sampled companies. The mean, median, and standard deviation of these indicators provide valuable insights into sector-specific performance and compliance levels.\n\nIn conclusion, each component of the ESG framework\u2014environmental, social, and governance\u2014has a significantly positive impact on the profitability of organizations within industries characterized by significant environmental impact. Therefore, by comprehensively implementing an ESG framework, these industries can fulfill their environmental and social responsibilities while simultaneously improving their financial performance.\n\n5 Discussion\n\n5.1 Research conclusions\n\nThis study systematically examines the impact of ESG system implementation on firm profitability in industries characterized by significant environmental impact in China. The findings indicate that companies with comprehensive ESG systems achieve substantially better financial outcomes over a 4-year period compared to those without such systems.\n\n5.1.1 Overall impact of ESG systems on corporate performance\n\nMultiple regression analysis reveals a significant positive correlation between a company's overall ESG score and its financial performance, as measured by ROA and ROE. This suggests that increased investments in environmental protection, social responsibility, and corporate governance can lead to higher financial returns for companies in industries with substantial environmental impact. These findings provide organizations with a stronger scientific basis for developing effective ESG strategies (Li and Pang, 2023).\n\n5.1.2 Impact of the environmental dimension\n\nThe research highlights that the environmental protection score significantly influences business efficiency, particularly through improved resource utilization and cost-effectiveness. Investments in environmental protection can yield long-term financial benefits. By enhancing environmental performance, companies in industries with significant environmental impact can not only comply with increasingly stringent regulations but also improve their market competitiveness (Liu et al., 2024).\n\n5.1.3 Impact of the social dimension\n\nThe study also validates a positive correlation between social responsibility and corporate performance. Investments in employee welfare, community engagement, and supply chain management can enhance brand value and customer loyalty, thereby contributing to improved financial performance.\n\n5.1.4 Impact of the governance dimension\n\nThe governance dimension has the most pronounced impact on corporate performance. Strong corporate governance not only increases management efficiency but also enhances transparency and investor confidence, leading to significant improvements in financial performance (Qiang et al., 2023).\n\n5.2 Research contributions\n\nThis study makes significant contributions both theoretically and practically:\n\n\u2022 Theoretical contributions: by thoroughly analyzing the specific impact of each ESG dimension on corporate performance, this study enriches the existing literature on the relationship between ESG systems and corporate outcomes, particularly in the context of industries characterized by significant environmental impact. The findings illuminate the unique role of ESG system implementation in these sectors, filling a critical research gap and providing new perspectives for future studies.\n\n\u2022 Practical contributions: the study offers actionable management recommendations for executives in industries with substantial environmental challenges, guiding them to balance environmental, social, and economic goals when formulating ESG strategies. Additionally, the results provide robust scientific evidence to inform government policy, encouraging companies to actively fulfill social responsibilities, promote green transformation, and achieve high-quality economic growth (Qing and Jin, 2023).\n\n5.3 Policy and management recommendations\n\nBased on the research findings, the following policy and management recommendations are proposed:\n\n\u2022 Strengthen ESG system implementation: companies in industries with significant environmental impact should continue to increase investments in ESG system implementation, particularly in optimizing governance structures and improving environmental performance (Shen and Wang, 2024). Through systematic management and transparent disclosure, companies can enhance both their market competitiveness and financial performance.\n\n\u2022 Set long-Term ESG goals: companies should establish clear long-term ESG objectives and develop scientific performance evaluation mechanisms. Regular assessment and monitoring of progress in environmental, social responsibility, and governance areas through both quantitative and qualitative indicators will ensure sustained improvement (Su et al., 2023).\n\n\u2022 Government policy support: governments should develop and refine relevant laws and regulations, clearly defining corporate obligations in environmental protection and social responsibility (Tan et al., 2024). Policies such as tax incentives, financial subsidies, and green credit should be leveraged to encourage companies to increase investments in environmental technologies and sustainable development (Wang et al., 2023).\n\n5.4 Conclusion\n\nThis study provides a systematic analysis of the impact of ESG system implementation on the performance of companies in industries characterized by significant environmental impact in China. By employing quantitative methods such as multiple regression analysis and event study methodology, the research reveals significant relationships between the ESG dimensions\u2014environmental, social, and governance\u2014and corporate performance indicators, specifically ROE and ROA. The findings underscore the critical role of ESG practices in enhancing financial performance, particularly in sectors facing substantial environmental and social challenges.\n\nThe research offers empirical evidence linking ESG factors with corporate performance in industries with significant environmental impact in China. These findings are further validated through robustness tests and event analysis, providing valuable insights for both practitioners and policymakers. However, the study also acknowledges its limitations and offers recommendations for future research to address these gaps and extend the findings. It is asserted that implementing and maintaining an ESG system not only aids a company in achieving sustainability but also drives sustained financial performance in sectors with substantial environmental challenges. As societal expectations for ESG practices continue to grow, future studies will be essential in deepening our understanding of the complex relationships between ESG practices and business efficiency across various sectors and regions.\n\n6 Conclusion\n\n6.1 Research conclusions\n\n6.1.1 Overall impact of ESG system implementation on corporate performance in industries with serious environmental impact\n\nThe outcomes of this investigation validate a similar impact in practice among corporate organizations adopting the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) system, since it is backed with both empirical evidence and case studies. The findings suggest that the successful implementation of ESG systems is much more than just an association with a healthy bottom line but is also an essential driver in financial management for the sectors that are at the same time hardest hit by the environmental crisis. Sense fully, Triple ESG Three Pillars\u2014Environment, Social Responsibility, and Corporate Governance provide positive impact on corporate management performance (Wang and Chang, 2024). The properly designed ESG system creates the way out for companies in industries with emerging environmental challenges and helps to gain not only economics but also social objectives by approaching environmental and social concerns more effectively (Wang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022).\n\n6.1.2 Major findings and contributions\n\n6.1.2.1 Research findings\n\n\u2022 Positive correlation between ESG system implementation and corporate performance: the analyses of multiple regressions give great evidence for a connection between a firm's general ESG score and relevant indicators of corporate performance like return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA). This signifies that the use of an ESG framework can massively boost the returns from businesses in this sector.\n\n\u2022 Elements of environmental dimension: the environmental protection (E) score shown in the regression analysis appears to be high and is significantly and positively associated with performance. This implies that, provided a company in an industry with a lot of impact on the environment, an investment in environmental protection, it can lessen environmental costs, enhance utilization efficiency, and probably improve financial performance.\n\n\u2022 Impact of the social responsibility D (S): the results substantiate the fact that a certain degree of correlation exists between social responsibility profiles and corporate performance. From this perspective, initiatives exhibited in organizational culture (including employee well-being, community responsibilities, and customer interactions) have considerable effects on productivity and customer loyalty level leading to corporate success.\n\n\u2022 Consequence of a governance factor (G): the governance aspect manifests a perfect positive relationship with the corporation's performance. This means that structuring governance systems to allow for expedient decision making and efficient managerial actions could be the means through which financial performance is maximized.\n\n6.1.2.2 Research contributions\n\n\u2022 Theoretical contribution: this research advances the theoretical understanding of the relationship between ESG systems and corporate performance by elucidating the specific impact mechanisms of ESG implementation in industries characterized by significant environmental challenges, supported by empirical analysis and case studies.\n\n\u2022 Practical contribution: the study provides empirical evidence and actionable management recommendations for companies in environmentally impactful industries, guiding them in achieving environmental and social responsibility goals while enhancing financial performance.\n\n\u2022 Policy contribution: this research offers a scientific foundation for government policy formulation and the promotion of ESG practices, supporting the transformation and sustainable development of industries facing significant environmental challenges.\n\n6.2 Research limitations and future directions\n\n6.2.1 Limitations\n\nThere are several limitations in this study that must be acknowledged. First, the sample consists primarily of listed companies in China within industries characterized by significant environmental impact. As a result, the research findings may not be generalizable to other regions or industries. Additionally, the Wind database used in this study may not capture all aspects of ESG, particularly in the social and environmental dimensions, due to data gaps. Furthermore, the linearity assumption in the regression model suggests that there may be other important factors influencing the relationship between ESG scores and corporate performance that were not considered in this analysis. It is also important to note that the event study methodology employed here focuses on short-term implications of ESG practices, which may not fully capture long-term effects.\n\n6.2.2 Future research directions\n\nTo enhance the validity and generalizability of future research, it is recommended that researchers diversify the sample to include companies from different countries and economic sectors. Extending the study's timeframe from short-term to long-term could also help identify persistent trends and the enduring impact of ESG practices on corporate objectives. Future studies should consider incorporating additional factors into the regression model, such as corporate governance and market conditions, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms at play. Moreover, qualitative research methods, including case studies and expert interviews, could offer deeper insights into how ESG activities influence corporate performance. Finally, further examination of the interactions among the three ESG dimensions\u2014environmental, social, and governance\u2014could yield a more nuanced understanding of their collective impact on company performance.\n\nData availability statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nQL: Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

            "article_text": "This is a time to be bold. To go all in. Be Digital.\n\nIn my keynote yesterday at OpenText World 2021, I revealed how the world\u2019s best-run organizations are choosing to go all-in on digital. They are using Information Management to solve the challenges of today\u2019s global market, respond to disruption, build stronger communities and thrive.\n\nGlobal events are driving the Great Rethink across all aspects of our lives\u2014the economy, industry, society, environment, geopolitics, individuals and technology. We have an opportunity to reimagine the future. We can leverage ingenuity and technology to overcome our toughest obstacles and create a better world.\n\nFive Forces Changing Everything\n\nI see five major forces that are changing forever the way we do business.\n\nFive Forces Changing Everything\n\nAll Work Is Distributed: It\u2019s about how you work, not where you work. Every organization faces a choice: will they stay centralized or shift to distributed work? Leaders are wondering when employees will go back to the office, but the truth is that the best employees don\u2019t have to. Flex-first work models help retain top performers and open up resources. They bolster diversity and inclusion, and let us hire (as we say in Canada) from coast to coast to coast. All Transactions Are Going Digital: Email, video, payments, signature, commerce, food delivery, business systems, renewals\u2014all are going virtual and paperless. Industry 4.0 is in hyperdrive! The supply chain of tomorrow is a digital-first supply network. It enables businesses to sell everywhere, all the time, with rapid delivery, deep visibility and sustainability. Seven-Star Experience: At the end of every supply chain is a consumer. Organizations need to deliver personalized, timely customer experiences that wow. Think about what you can do to grow your business, and view everything you do through the eyes of your customers. Don\u2019t aim for five stars. Aim for seven. Trust and Security:Everything must be built on a platform of trust and security. Organizations need to implement a Zero Trust model, so that if your laptop suddenly grows legs and walks away, you are still secure! Systems must be always on\u2014and always protected. The Future of Growth Needs to Be Sustainable and Inclusive: The past 18 months have made it clear that companies have an opportunity to create positive change. Organizations need to champion Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, improve their environmental footprint and strengthen their use of technology for good.\n\nThe world\u2019s most successful organizations are transforming these five forces into opportunities. They strive to be global and connect to ecosystems that span the world. They make large investments, so they can own their digital capabilities. They are shifting from a process advantage to an information advantage, with automation and optimized data analysis. They understand that the future is cloud + edge, working in tandem. And they know how to leverage the right mix of off-cloud, private cloud, public cloud and API cloud to get results.\n\nOpenText Cloud Editions delivers capabilities that help organizations tackle these five forces. Cloud Editions encompasses five purpose-driven clouds\u2014Content Cloud, Business Network Cloud, Experience Cloud, Security & Protection Cloud, and Developer Cloud. Together, they enable organizations to master modern work, build sustainable supply networks, power modern customer experiences, become cyber resilient, drive the API economy, and choose sustainable practices.\n\nOpenText Cloud Editions\n\nYesterday, I shared parts of our conversations with some extraordinary customers\u2014L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Morgan Stanley and Shell. Each of them is leveraging Cloud Editions to drive growth, spur innovation and build a sustainable future. Watch the full-length versions of the interviews later in OpenText World to get deep insights into how these customers are using technology to transform and thrive. It is time to be digital, and OpenText is lighting the way.\n\nThe Digital Road Ahead\n\nOpenText Cloud Editions brings incredible capabilities to the table. If you compare us to IBM\u2014there is no comparison! We are the market leader in Content Services Platforms on Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant. We deliver superior solutions across public cloud, private cloud, and integrations with apps. We are focused on Content Services, and we are committed to an aggressive program of R&D investments to keep delivering the solutions in the cloud that our customers need.\n\nIt\u2019s time to say Bye Bye Blue! We are so confident that we can deliver a better suite of products and solutions than our competitors, that we are launching a new initiative to help organizations migrate away from IBM. And we can help you do it in 90 days or less!\n\nWith Cloud Editions, you will be part of an exciting roadmap of new technologies.\n\nCloud Editions: The Digital Road Ahead\n\nOur battle cry is new releases every 90 days. Updates are automatically rolled out, so you always have the latest technologies and features. We are heavily investing in R&D over the next five years. By the time we release Cloud Editions 23.2, more than 80% of our R&D spend will be in the cloud. And we provide a team of over 6,000 dedicated professionals to drive cloud innovations, global cloud operations, platform transformation\u2014and your cloud success.\n\nIt is a visionary product roadmap, with exciting capabilities to come in the months and years ahead.\n\nThe OpenText ZERO Initiative\n\nThe greatest challenge humanity faces in the long-term may not be the pandemic, but climate change. We believe in our core that the future of growth is sustainable and inclusive, and we are going to bring the OpenText voice and way to this future.\n\nI am proud to announce our new program, the OpenText ZERO Initiative. We have laid out concrete benchmarks as we strive towards Zero Emissions, Zero Waste and Zero Barriers. We are committing to net zero GHGs by 2040. Zero waste from operations by 2030. And the majority of OpenText employees will be diverse by 2030, with equal gender representation in key roles, and at least 40% of leadership roles filled by women.\n\nThe OpenText ZERO Initiative\n\nWe will also partner with local organizations to enhance education opportunities and tackle food insecurity in the communities where we work and live.\n\nOur approach will be science-based and bold. I am eager to update you on our progress in the days ahead, as we watch the goals of the ZERO Initiative become a reality.\n\nThe Future of Growth\n\nThe future of growth will demand that organizations adapt to continuous disruption, fulfill their roles as responsible global citizens, and leverage technology to fuel innovation and grow.\n\nOpenText helps organizations reach these goals. We are #1 in Information Management. We are investing $2.2 billion to deliver the world\u2019s most complete and integrated Information Management Cloud. And we are leading the way in inclusivity and sustainability with the OpenText ZERO Initiative.\n\nI look forward to working with our customers, colleagues, partners and communities, as we build together the future of growth.\n\nBe well. Be happy. Be bold. Be digital."

Attract more eco-aware customers\n\nConsumers are increasingly eco-conscious, meaning that adopting a sustainable strategy can boost your reputation and give you a competitive edge against other businesses.\n\n2. Supply chain requirements\n\nCompanies supplying government, large organisations, and other businesses may need to strengthen the environmental, social, and ethical robustness of their business.\n\nOrganisations are placing supply chains under renewed scrutiny as environmental management gains traction in a bid to tackle climate change and sustainability issues.\n\nSMEs that don't hold environmental standards, such as ISO 14001, may find themselves unable to demonstrate that they meet regulatory or contractual requirements.\n\n3. Employee engagement\n\nGreen-spirited companies could benefit from attracting and retaining staff with 28% of employees check a company's sustainability practices before applying for a job, rising to 39% for millennials according to research by TotalJobs.\n\nIf your business has Green credentials, you'll attract like-minded employees who will help the company embed its green practices.\n\nResearch by Lloyds Bank found that environmental values positively boost employee spirit, leading to staff retention.\n\n4. Reduced waste and lower operating costs\n\nReducing waste, being more energy efficient, or complying with local environmental regulations may help save you money in the long term.\n\nAround 40% of SMEs cited commercial rationale as a reason for green actions, such as upgrading vehicles to meet air pollution rules so that they can continue to operate in Clean Air Zones without paying toll fees.\n\nLess waste may often be the result of more efficient manufacturing processes, improving efficiency, and lowering the cost of storing and processing excess waste.\n\n5. Comply with regulations\n\nRegulations are put in place to encourage sustainable practices and future legislation is likely to help Government meet any climate change pledges.\n\nExisting measures include:\n\nThese measures attempt to reduce waste and carbon emissions; non-compliance can lead to fines and harm a business\u2019 reputation.\n\n6. Investment attractiveness\n\nAs a company with green credentials, your business may be increasingly attractive to investors.\n\nEven if you haven't yet made the step to be greener, creating a plan to do so in the future may draw investors in to help you make improvements.\n\nBusinesses that are less reliant on fossil fuels may be seen as more resilient against fluctuations in energy prices, for example.\n\n7. Drives innovative ways of working\n\nChange, new legislation and shifting customer demand can be a driver for innovation within a business.\n\nThe need to be more sustainable can spark new ways of operating, new processes and new products \u2013 all with the potential to drive efficiencies, open alternate markets and attract new customers."

            "article_text": "60 organizations released an open letter for the European Union to act on ESG disclosure standards.\n\nThey encourage the European Commission to promote a global baseline set of standards through supporting the IFRS Foundation on the launch of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).\n\nFind the full text of the letter below.\n\n\n\nThis statement is signed by 60 organizations representing over EUR 8.5 trillion in assets and employing over 5 million people. It is released with the support and coordination of the European Round Table for Industry, the Value Balancing Alliance, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Economic Forum.\n\nAs leading organizations with a global reach, we recognize that the context in which businesses now operate has been transformed by climate change, nature loss, social unrest around inclusion and working conditions, and the changing expectations of the role of corporations. Further, the global pandemic has exacerbated underlying and longstanding challenges regarding equality and access to economic opportunities.\n\nWe support the ambition of the European Green Deal and commit to playing our role to build corporate resilience and enhance our license to operate through greater commitment to long-term, sustainable value creation as well as by considering the needs of all our stakeholders.\n\nWe believe these efforts and commitments need to be supported by globally consistent and comparable performance metrics and disclosures, to enhance decision-making, trust, and accountability. Sustainability needs to be integrated into accounting and reporting systems.\n\nHowever, preparers and consumers of environmental, social and governance (ESG) data all over the world are still struggling with a profusion of reporting frameworks and standards that do not enable consistent and comparable disclosures.\n\nThe standardization that has already taken place in financial accounting offers a blueprint for success. In the past, accounting faced myriad metrics, jurisdictions and organisations, and coordination took decades. The global accounting rules in place today ensure that company performance in any industry or country is comparable and companies can be held to account by investors.\n\nTo achieve a similar outcome on the ESG front \u2013 and to do so fast \u2013 the world should follow the same template and establish an independent body that can ensure objectivity and due process. We therefore strongly support the initiative of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation to create an International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to develop globally accepted standards for sustainability reporting that can be adopted worldwide.\n\nWe also acknowledge that there are jurisdictions that are more advanced in embracing sustainability and want to go further and faster to meet specific policy priorities. We therefore support the European Commission in its aims to promote high-quality ESG standards as part of the continent\u2019s green economy transition, through its proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), including through the introduction of European sustainability reporting standards to be developed following the establishment of a new standard-setting body within the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG).\n\nHigh-quality standards should be based on principles of legitimacy, independence, transparency, public accountability, and thorough due process. Stakeholder engagement and due process must be inclusive and allow for high-quality input from the business community. We therefore call on the European Commission to set up a robust and inclusive due process for developing its own sustainability standards, as outlined in its proposed directive. This is important as any future standards will be adopted by delegated acts with direct effect on companies. In this regard, we welcome EFRAG\u2019s consultation on its future due process.\n\nAs investors and organizations with global operations, we rely on international supply chains and attract capital from across the world. Global alignment of reporting standards is crucial to provide a comprehensive view of a company\u2019s sustainability performance. We encourage the European Commission to support the establishment of the International Sustainability Standards Board and actively and urgently promote cooperation between EFRAG and the new Board. Increased international cooperation in aligning and harmonizing sustainability reporting standards is essential to ensure a global level playing field. To meet the needs of the financial and capital markets, non-financial reporting standards must be global.\n\nWe support the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the IFRS Foundation in their recommendation of a \u2018building block approach\u2019 for the establishment of a globally-consistent foundation of sustainability standards, upon which national and regional standard-setters may build supplementary standards that serve their specific jurisdictional needs. We note that this model has recently been endorsed by G7 and G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, including the European Union.\n\nWe believe this approach is necessary to minimize the risk of divergence, inconsistency and lack of comparability, which would risk creating an unlevel playing field. This could double the reporting burden in countries where differing standards exist. Worse still, capital markets would continue to be unable to effectively channel investments towards sustainable businesses \u2013 hampering the necessary restructuring of the global financial system towards long-term value creation, inclusivity, and resilience.\n\nConsequently, we encourage constructive cooperation between the future European sustainability standard-setting body, EFRAG, and relevant international initiatives to maintain a building blocks approach. IOSCO\u2019s proposal for a multi-stakeholder consultative committee to operate within the IFRS Foundation structure could help promote consistency and comparability with jurisdiction-specific reporting standards. The appropriate presence of multilateral bodies and major stakeholders in such a body, including the European Commission, could provide the necessary support for achieving a global baseline and an effective mechanism for cooperation with national or regional standard-setters.\n\nAs global organizations with operations in Europe, we know that doing business in more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient ways is one of the crucial challenges of our time. With its international standing and leadership role on the sustainability agenda, the European Union can be a key force behind global cooperation and alignment on ESG reporting standards. We support the institutions of the European Union in this effort and stand ready to contribute with our experience.\n\nSigned\n\nABN AMRO\n\nAdecco Group\n\nAIB Group\n\nAir Liquide\n\nAllianz\n\nArabesque\n\nBASF\n\nBBVA\n\nBDO\n\nBMW\n\nDeloitte\n\nDeutsche Bank\n\nDeutsche Post DHL\n\nEnel\n\nENERGIAS DE PORTUGAL SA\n\nENGIE Group\n\nEni\n\nEricsson\n\nEurasian Resources Group (ERG)\n\nEuroclear\n\nEY\n\nGalp Energia\n\nHEINEKEN\n\nHolcim\n\nIberdrola\n\nIngka Group\n\nJLL\n\nKPMG\n\nLeonardo\n\nManpowerGroup\n\nMerck\n\nMitsubishi Chemical Holdings\n\nMOL group\n\nNasdaq\n\nNeste\n\nNovo Nordisk\n\nNovozymes\n\nPlanet\n\nPorsche AG\n\nPwC\n\nRabobank\n\nRoyal DSM\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell\n\nRoyal Philips\n\nSabanci Holding\n\nSalesforce\n\nSana Kliniken AG\n\nSAP\n\nSchneider Electric\n\nSiemens\n\nSK Group\n\nSnam\n\nSonae\n\nStora Enso\n\nSumitomo Corporation\n\nSumitomo Mitsui Financial Group\n\nTotalEnergies\n\nUBS\n\nUmicore\n\nYara International"

            "article_text": "In 2024, over 3,500 companies actively participated in the CSA. The CSA compares companies across 62 industries via industry-specific questionnaires that assess, on average, 23 sustainability topics in 110 questions. Based on their performance, companies receive scores ranging from 0 to 100 and percentile rankings for financially relevant sustainability criteria.\n\nParticipating companies represent nearly half of global market capitalization (relative to the S&P Global Broad Market Index). Participants also represent 44% of the companies in the S&P Global LargeMid Cap Index, 55% of companies in the S&P 500 Index, and 58% of companies in the S&P Global 1200 Index. Over the past 25 years, as the CSA has grown into a leading corporate sustainability database, it has also attracted the interest of capital market stakeholders. Hundreds of clients from more than 12 industries and over 50 countries directly subscribe to ESG Scores and ESG Raw Data as a key output of the CSA. This group includes financial institutions managing $35 trillion in assets who can utilize these scores and data to benchmark corporate performance, manage investment portfolios, allocate financial capital, and build engagement strategies. Additionally, ESG Scores and ESG Raw Data are integral to the sustainability and climate indices produced by S&P Dow Jones Indices, such as the S&P 500 Scored & Screened Index, further extending their reach to even more clients and market segments.\n\nTo ensure the quality and objectivity of the CSA, S&P Global voluntarily appoints an independent third party, Deloitte, to conduct an external audit of the assessment process each year.\n\nDownload the assurance statement"

            "article_text": "The European Parliament approved with 374 votes against 235 and 19 abstentions the new \u201cdue diligence\u201d directive, agreed on with the Council, requiring firms and their upstream and downstream partners, including supply, production and distribution to prevent, end or mitigate their adverse impact on human rights and the environment. Such impact will include slavery, child labour, labour exploitation, biodiversity loss, pollution or destruction of natural heritage.\n\nRisk-based approach and transition plan\n\nThe rules will apply to EU companies and parent companies with over 1000 employees and a worldwide turnover higher than 450 million euro. It will also apply to companies with franchising or licensing agreements in the EU ensuring a common corporate identity with worldwide turnover higher than 80 million euro if at least 22.5 million euro was generated by royalties. Non-EU companies, parent companies and companies with franchising or licensing agreements in the EU reaching the same turnover thresholds in the EU will also be covered. These firms will have to integrate due diligence into their policies, make related investments, seek contractual assurances from their partners, improve their business plan or provide support to small and medium-sized business partners to ensure they comply with new obligations. Companies will also have to adopt a transition plan to make their business model compatible with the Paris Agreement global warming limit of 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nFines and compensation of victims\n\nMember states will be required to provide companies with detailed online information on their due diligence obligations via practical portals containing the Commission\u2019s guidance. They will also create or designate a supervisory authority to investigate and impose penalties on non-complying firms. These will include \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d and fines of up to 5% of companies\u2019 net worldwide turnover. The Commission will establish the European Network of Supervisory Authorities to support cooperation and enable exchange of best practices. Companies will be liable for damages caused by breaching their due diligence obligations and will have to fully compensate their victims.\n\nQuote\n\nFollowing the plenary vote, lead MEP Lara Wolters (S&D, NL) said: \"Today\u2019s vote is a milestone for responsible business conduct and a considerable step towards ending the exploitation of people and the planet by cowboy companies. This law is a hard-fought compromise and the result of many years of tough negotiations. I am proud of what we have achieved with our progressive allies. In Parliament\u2019s next mandate, we will fight not only for its swift implementation, but also for making Europe\u2019s economy even more sustainable.\u201d\n\nNext steps\n\nThe directive now also needs to be formally endorsed by the Council, signed and published in the EU Official Journal. It will enter into force twenty days later. Member states will have two years to transpose the new rules into their national laws.\n\nThe new rules (except for the communication obligations) will apply gradually to EU companies (and non-EU companies reaching the same turnover thresholds in the EU):\n\nFrom 2027 to companies with over 5000 employees and worldwide turnover higher than 1500 million euro;\n\nFrom 2028 to firms with over 3000 employees and a 900 million euro worldwide turnover;\n\nFrom 2029 to all the remaining companies within the scope of the directive (including those over 1000 employees and worldwide turnover higher than 450 million euro).\n\nBackground\n\nParliament has consistently called for more corporate accountability and mandatory due diligence legislation. The Commission proposal introduced on 23 February 2022 complements other existing and upcoming legislative acts, such as the deforestation regulation, conflict minerals regulation and regulation prohibiting products made with forced labour.\n\nBy adopting this legislation, Parliament is responding to citizens' expectations concerning sustainable consumption as expressed in proposal 5(13), strengthening the ethical dimension of trade as expressed in proposals 19(2) and 19(3) and the sustainable growth model as expressed in proposal 11(1) and 11(8) of the conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe."
